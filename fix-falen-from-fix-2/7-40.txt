This tiring trek through town extended
For two full hours;
then, quite late
Nearby St Chariton's it ended
Before a mansion's double gate.
For now they'll seek accommodation
With Tanya's aunt, a kind relation
Four years consumptive, sad to note.
In glasses and a torn old coat,
A grizzled Kalmuk came to meet them;
With sock in hand he led the way
To where the prostrate princess lay;
She called from parlour couch to greet them.
The two old ladies hugged and cried,
With shouts of joy on either side.
