And I, who saw my single duty
As heeding passion's siren song
To share with all the world her beauty,
Would take my merry Muse along
To rowdy feasts and altercations
The bane of midnight sentry stations;
And to each mad and fevered rout
She brought her gifts . . .
and danced about,
Bacchante-like, at all our revels,
And over wine she sang for guests;
And in those days when I was blest,
The young pursued my Muse like devils;
While I, mid friends, was drunk with pride
My flighty mistress at my side.
