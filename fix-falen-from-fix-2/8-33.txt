No answer came.
Eugene elected
to write again . . .
and then once more
With no reply.
He drives, dejected,
To some soire . . .
and by the door,
Sees her at once!
Her harshness stuns him!
Without a word the lady shuns him!
My god!
How stern that haughty brow,
What wintry frost surrounds her now!
Her lips express determination
To keep her fury in control!
Onegin stares with all his soul:
But where's distress?
Commiseration?
And where the tearstains?
. . .
Not a trace!
There's wrath alone upon that face . . .
