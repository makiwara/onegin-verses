The note was brief in its correctness,
A proper challenge or cartel:
Politely, but with cold directness,
It called him out and did it well.
Onegin, with his first reaction,
Quite curtly offered satisfaction
And bade the envoy, if he cared,
To say that he was quite prepared.
Avoiding further explanation,
Zaretsky, pleading much to do,
Arose . . .
and instantly withdrew.
Eugene, once left to contemplation
And face to face with his own soul,
Felt far from happy with his role.
