'The other. .
..
But we'll talk tomorrow;
And straightway too, to all her kin
We'll show your Tanya.
What a sorrow
That paying visits does me in;
I drag about like some poor laggard.
But here, your trip has left you haggard;
Let's all go have a nice long rest.
.
.
.
I've got no strength . . .
this weary breast
Finds even joy at times excessive,
Not only woe.
. . .
It's true, my dear,
I'm good for nothing now, I fear;
When one gets old, life turns oppressive.'
And all worn out, she wept a bit,
Then broke into a coughing fit.
