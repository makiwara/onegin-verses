(37-8) 39
But tea is brought: the girls demurely
Have scarcely taken cups in hand,
When suddenly from ballroom doorway
Bassoon and flute announce the band.
Elated by the music's bouncing,
His tea and rum at once renouncing,
That Paris of the local towns,
Good Petushkv, to Olga bounds;
To Tanya, Lensky;
Harlikva,
A maiden somewhat ripe in glow,
My Tambov poet takes in tow;
Buynov whirls off Pustyakva;
Then all the crowd comes pouring in
To watch the brilliant ballroom spin.
