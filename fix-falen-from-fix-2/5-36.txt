36
Whist's heroes have by now completed
Eight rubbers;
and eight times as well
They've shifted round and been reseated;
Now tea is brought.
I like to tell
The time of day by teas and dinners,
By supper's call.
We country sinners
Can tell the time without great fuss:
The stomach serves as clock for us;
And apropos, I might make mention
In passing that I speak as much
Of feasts and foods and corks and such
In these odd lines of my invention
As you, great Homer, you whose song
Has lasted thirty centuries long!
