(15-16) 17
Once more in solemn, rapt attention
Before his darling Olga's face,
Vladimir hasn't heart to mention
The night before and what took place;
'It's up to me,' he thought, 'to save her.
I'll never let that foul depraver
Corrupt her youthful heart with lies,
With fiery praise . . .
and heated sighs;
Nor see that noxious worm devour
My lovely lily, stalk and blade;
Nor watch this two-day blossom fade
When it has yet to fully flower.'
All this, dear readers, meant in fine:
I'm duelling with a friend of mine.
