With whom, I wonder?
Buynov tried: she turned him down.
And Petushkv as well went under.

To stay with us and seemed transported;

But no!

To Moscow and the marriage mart!
They've vacancies galore . . .
take heart!'
'But I've so little income, father.'
'Sufficient for one winter's stay;
Or borrow thenfrom me, let's say.'
