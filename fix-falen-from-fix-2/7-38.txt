38
Farewell now, scene of fame unsteady,
Petrvsky Castle.
Hey!
Be fleet!
There gleam the city gates already!
And now along Tverskya Street
The sleigh glides over ruts and passes
By sentry booths and peasant lasses;
By gardens, mansions, fashion shops;
Past urchins, streetlamps, strolling fops,
Bokhrins, sleighs, apothecaries,
Muzhiks and merchants, Cossack guards;
Past towers, hovels, boulevards,
Great balconies and monasteries;
Past gateway lions' lifted paws,
And crosses dense with flocks of daws.
