And now they trundle Tanya daily
To family dinners just to share
With grandams and granduncles gaily
Her languid and abstracted air.
Those kin who've come from distant places
Are always met with warm embraces,
With shouts of joy and welcome cheer.
'How Tanya's grown!
It seems, my dear,
So short a time since I baptized you!' '
And since I dried your baby tears!'
'And since I pulled you by the ears!'
'And since my gingerbread surprised you!'
And with one voice the grannies cry:
'Good gracious, how the years do fly!'
