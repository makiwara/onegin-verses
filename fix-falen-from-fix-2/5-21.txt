21
The heated words grow louder, quicken;
Onegin snatches up a knife,
And Lensky falls;
the shadows thicken;
A rending cry amid the strife
Reverberates ... the cabin quivers;
Gone numb with terror, Tanya shivers . . .
And wakes to find her room alight,
The frozen windows sparkling bright,
Where dawn's vermilion rays are playing;
Then Olga pushes through the door,
More rosy than the dawn before
And lighter than a swallow, saying:
'Oh, tell me, do, Tatyana love,
Who was it you were dreaming of?'
