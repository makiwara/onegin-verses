On coming to, she looks around her:
She's in a hall;
no bear at least;
The clink of glasses, shouts . . .
confound her,
As if it were some funeral feast;
She can't make sense of what she's hearing,
Creeps to the door and, softly peering,
Sees through a crack the strangest thing
A horde of monsters in a ring:
Out of a dog-face horns are sprouting;
One has a rooster's head on top;
A goateed witch is on a mop;
A haughty skeleton sits pouting
Beside a short-tailed dwarf. . .
and that
Is half a crane and half a cat.
