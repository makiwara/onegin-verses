14
And in the solitude her passion
Burns even stronger than before
Her heart speaks out in urgent fashion
Of faraway Eugene the more
She'll never see him . .
and be grateful
She finds a brother's slayer hateful
And loathes the awful thing he's done
The poet's gone . .
and hardly one
Remembers him
his bride's devotion
Has flown to someone else instead
His very memory now has fled
Like smoke across an azure ocean
Two hearts, perhaps, remain forlorn
And mourn him yet. . .
But wherefore mourn?
