'In all this world what's more perverted
Than homes in which the wretched wife
Bemoans her worthless mate, deserted
Alone both day and night through life
Or where the husband, knowing truly
Her worth (yet cursing fate unduly)
Is always angry, sullen, mute
A coldly jealous, selfish brute!
Well, thus am I. And was it merely
For this your ardent spirit pined
When you, with so much strength of mind
Unsealed your heart to me so clearly?
Can Fate indeed be so unkind?
Is this the lot you've been assigned?
