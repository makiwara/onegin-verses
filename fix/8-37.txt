37
But then as torpor dulled sensation
His feelings and his thoughts went slack
While in his mind Imagination
Dealt out her motley faro pack
He sees a youth, quite still, reposing
On melting snowas if he's dozing
On bivouac
then hears with dread
A voice proclaim: 'Well then, he's dead!'
He sees forgotten foes he'd bested
Base cowards, slanderers full-blown
Unfaithful women he had known
Companions whom he now detested . .
A country house ... a windowsill. .
Where she sits waiting . .
waiting still!
