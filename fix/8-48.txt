She left him then
Eugene, forsaken
Stood seared, as if by heaven's fire
How deep his stricken heart is shaken!
With what a tempest of desire!
A sudden clink of spurs rings loudly
As Tanya's husband enters proudly
And here ... at this unhappy turn
For my poor hero, we'll adjourn
And leave him, reader, at his station. .
For long . .
forever
In his train
We've roamed the world down one slim lane
For long enough
Congratulation
On reaching land at last
Hurray!
And long since time, I'm sure you'd say!
