And fear assails her
in a panic
She tries to flee . .
but feels too weak
In anguished writhing, almost manic
She wants to scream . .
but cannot speak
Eugene throws wide the door, revealing
To monstrous looks and hellish squealing
Her slender form
fierce cackles sound
In savage glee
all eyes turn round
All hooves and trunksgrotesque and curving
And whiskers, tusks, and tufted tails
Red bloody tongues and snouts and nails
Huge horns and bony fingers swerving
All point at her and all combine
To shout as one: 'She's mine!
She's mine!'
