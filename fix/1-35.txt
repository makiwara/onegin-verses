But what of my Eugene?
Half drowsing
He drives to bed from last night's ball
While Petersburg, already rousing
Answers the drumbeat's duty call
The merchant's up, the pedlar scurries
With jug in hand the milkmaid hurries
Crackling the freshly fallen snow
The cabby plods to hackney row
In pleasant hubbub morn's awaking!
The shutters open, smoke ascends
In pale blue shafts from chimney ends
The German baker's up and baking
And more than once, in cotton cap
Has opened up his window-trap
