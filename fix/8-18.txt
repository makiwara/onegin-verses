'You're married!
Really?''
On my honour.'
'To whom?
How long?''
Some two years since . .
The Larin girl.''
You mean Tatyana!'
'She knows you?''
We were neighbours, Prince.'
'Well then, come on . .
we'll go and meet her.'
And so the prince led up to greet her
His kinsman and his friend Eugene
The princess looked at himserene
However much the situation
Disturbed her soul and caused her pain
However great her shock or strain
She gave no hint of agitation:
Her manner stayed the same outside
Her bow was calm and dignified
