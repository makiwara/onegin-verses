And then her warm imagination
Perceives herself as heroine
Some favourite author's fond creation:
Clarissa, Julia, or Delphine
She wanders with her borrowed lovers
Through silent woods and so discovers
Within a book her heart's extremes
Her secret passions, and her dreams
She sighs . .
and in her soul possessing
Another's joy, another's pain
She whispers in a soft refrain
The letter she would send caressing
Her hero . .
who was none the less
No Grandison in Russian dress
