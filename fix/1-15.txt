15
Some mornings still abed he drowses
Until his valet brings his tray
What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
Have asked him to a grand soire
There'll be a ball, a children's party
Where will he dash to, my good hearty?
Where will he make the night's first call?
Oh, never mindhe'll make them all
But meanwhile, dressed for morning pleasure
Bedecked in broad-brimmed Bolivar
He drives to Nevsky Boulevard
To stroll about at total leisure
Until Brguet's unsleeping chime
Reminds him that it's dinner time
