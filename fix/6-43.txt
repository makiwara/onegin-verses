43
But not today
Although I cherish
My hero and of course I vow
To see how he may wane or flourish
I'm not quite in the mood just now
The years to solemn prose incline me
The years chase playful rhyme behind me
And Ialas, I must confess
Pursue her now a good deal less
My pen has lost its disposition
To mar the fleeting page with verse
For other, colder dreams I nurse
And sterner cares now seek admission
And mid the hum and hush of life
They haunt my soul with dreams of strife
