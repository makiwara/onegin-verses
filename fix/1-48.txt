48
Filled with his heart's regrets, and leaning
Against the rampart's granite shelf
Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
(As once some poet drew himself)
The night grew still. . with silence falling
Only the sound of sentries calling
Or suddenly from Million Street
Some distant droshky's rumbling beat
Or floating on the drowsy river
A lonely boat would sail along
While far away some rousing song
Or plaintive horn would make us shiver
But sweeter still, amid such nights
Are Tasso's octaves' soaring flights
