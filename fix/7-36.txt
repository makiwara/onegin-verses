But now they're near
Before them, gleaming
Lies Moscow with its stones of white
Its ancient domes and spires streaming
With golden crosses, ember-bright
Ah, friends, I too have been delighted
When all at once far-off I've sighted
That splendid view of distant domes
Of churches, belfries, stately homes!
How oft. .
forlorn and separated
When wayward fate has made me stray
I've dreamt of Moscow far away!
Ah, Moscow!
How that sound is freighted
With meaning for our Russian hearts!
How many echoes it imparts!
