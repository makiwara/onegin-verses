Has my Eugene directly hastened?
You've guessed already
Yes, indeed:
The moody fellow, still unchastened
Has flown to Tanya's in his need
He enters like a dead man, striding
Through empty hall
then passes, gliding
Through grand salon
And on!
All bare
He opens up a door. . .
What's there
That strikes him with such awful pleading?
The princess sits alone in sight
Quite unadorned, her face gone white
Above some letter that she's reading
And cheek in hand as down she peers
She softly sheds a flood of tears
