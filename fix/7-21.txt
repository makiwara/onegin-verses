21
Outside the gate Tatyana parted
From old Anisya
Next day then
She rose at dawn and off she started
To see the empty house again
And once inside that silent study
Sealed off at last from everybody
The world for just a time forgot
Tatyana wept and mourned her lot. .
Then turned to see the books he'd favoured
At first she didn't wish to read
The choice of books seemed strange indeed
But soon her thirsting spirit savoured
The mystery that those pages told
And watched a different world unfold
