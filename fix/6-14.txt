'Why did you leave last night so early?'
Was all that Olga, smiling, said
P
oor Lensky's muddled mind was swirling
And silently he hung his head
All jealousy and rage departed
Before that gaze so openhearted
Before that soft and simple trust
Before that soul so bright and just!
With misty eyes he looks on sweetly
And sees the truth: she loves him yet!
Tormented now by deep regret
He craves her pardon so completely
He trembles, hunts for words in vain:
He's happy now, he's almost sane. . .
(15-16) 17
Once more in solemn, rapt attention
Before his darling Olga's face
Vladimir hasn't heart to mention
The night before and what took place
'It's up to me,' he thought, 'to save her
I'll never let that foul depraver
Corrupt her youthful heart with lies
With fiery praise . .
and heated sighs
Nor see that noxious worm devour
My lovely lily, stalk and blade
Nor watch this two-day blossom fade
When it has yet to fully flower.'
All this, dear readers, meant in fine:
I'm duelling with a friend of mine
