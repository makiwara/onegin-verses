And now from nearby quarters, brothers
That idol whom ripe misses cheer
The joy and hope of district mothers
The company commander's here!
He's brought some news to set them cheering:
The regimental band's appearing!
'The colonel's sending it tonight.'
There'll be a ball!
What sheer delight!
The girls all jump and grow excited
But dinner's served
And so by pairs
And arm in arm, they seek their chairs:
The girls near Tanya
men delighted
To face them
and amid the din
All cross themselves and dig right in
