Of course the love of tender beauties
Is surer far than friends or kin:
Your claim upon its joyous duties
Survives when even tempests spin
Of course it's so
And yet be wary
For fashions change, and views will vary
And nature's made of wayward stuff
The charming sex is light as fluff
What's more, the husband's frank opinion
Is bound by any righteous wife
To be respected in this life
And so your mistress (faithful minion)
May in a trice be swept away:
For Satan treats all love as play
