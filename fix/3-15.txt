Tatyana, O my dear Tatyana!
I shed with you sweet tears too late
Relying on a tyrant's honour
You've now resigned to him your fate
My dear one, you are doomed to perish
But first in dazzling hope you nourish
And summon forth a sombre bliss
You learn life's sweetness... feel its kiss
And drink the draught of love's temptations
As phantom daydreams haunt your mind:
On every side you seem to find
Retreats for happy assignations
While everywhere before your eyes
Your fateful tempter's figure lies
