44
Once more an idler, now he smothers
The emptiness that plagues his soul
By making his the thoughts of others
A laudable and worthy goal
He crammed his bookshelf overflowing
Then read and readfrustration growing:
Some raved or lied, and some were dense
Some lacked all conscience
some, all sense
Each with a different dogma girded
The old was dated through and through
While nothing new was in the new
So books, like women, he deserted
And over all that dusty crowd
He draped a linen mourning shroud
