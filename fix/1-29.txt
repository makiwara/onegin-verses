29
In days of dreams and dissipations
On balls I madly used to dote:
No surer place for declarations
Or for the passing of a note
And so I offer, worthy spouses
My services to save your houses:
I pray you, heed my sound advice
A word of warning should suffice
You too, you mamas, I commend you
To keep your daughters well in sight
Don't lower your lorgnettes at night!
Or else ... or else .. may God defend you!
All this I now can let you know
Since I dropped sinning long ago
