'Twas evening and the heavens darkled
A beetle hummed
The peasant choirs
Were bound for home
Still waters sparkled
Across the river, smoky fires
Of fishermen were dimly gleaming
Tatyana walked, alone and dreaming
Beneath the moonbeams' silver light
And climbed a gentle hill by night
She walked and walked
till with a shiver
She spied a distant hamlet's glow
A manor house and grove below
A garden by the glinting river
And as she gazed upon that place
Her pounding heart began to race
