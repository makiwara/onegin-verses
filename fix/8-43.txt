43
'Onegin, I was then much younger
I daresay better-looking too
And loved you with a girlish hunger
But what did I then find in you?
What answer came?
Just stern rejection
A little maiden's meek affection
To you, I'm sure, was trite and old
Oh God!my blood can still turn cold
When I recall how you reacted:
Your frigid glance . .
that sermonette!
.
But I can't blame you or forget
How nobly in a sense you acted
How right toward me that awful day:
I'm grateful now in every way. . .
