56
The country, love, green fields and flowers
Sweet idleness!
You have my heart
With what delight I praise those hours
That set Eugene and me apart
For otherwise some mocking reader
Or, God forbid, some wretched breeder
Of twisted slanders might combine
My hero's features here with mine
And then maintain the shameless fiction
That, like proud Byron, I have penned
A mere self-portrait in the end
As if today, through some restriction
We're now no longer fit to write
On any theme but our own plight
