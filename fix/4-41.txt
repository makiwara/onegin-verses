41
The dawn arises cold and cheerless
The empty fields in silence wait
And on the road... grown lean and fearless
The wolf appears with hungry mate
Catching the scent, the road horse quivers
And snorts in fear, the traveller shivers
And flies uphill with all his speed
No more at dawn does shepherd need
To drive the cows outside with ringing
Nor does his horn at midday sound
The call that brings them gathering round
Inside her hut a girl is singing
And by the matchwood's crackling light
She spins away the wintry night
