But forward, forward, o my story!
A new persona has arrived:
Five versts or so from Krasnogory
Our Lensky's seat, there lived and thrived
In philosophical seclusion
(And does so still, have no illusion)
Zartskyonce a rowdy clown
Chief gambler and arch rake in town
The tavern tribune and a liar
But now a kind and simple soul
Who plays an unwed father's role
A faithful friend, a peaceful squire
And man of honour, nothing less:
Thus does our age its sins redress!
