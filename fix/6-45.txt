45
And so, life's afternoon has started
As I must now admit, I see
But let us then as friends be parted
My sparkling youth, before you flee!
I thank you for your host of treasures
For pain and grief as well as pleasures
For storms and feasts and worldly noise
For all your gifts and all your joys
My thanks to you
With you I've tasted
Amid the tumult and the still
Life's essence . .
and enjoyed my fill
Enough!
Clear-souled and far from wasted
I start upon an untrod way
To take my rest from yesterday
