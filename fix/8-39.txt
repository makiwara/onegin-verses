39
The days flew by
The winter season
Dissolved amid the balmy air
He didn't die, or lose his reason
Or turn a poet in despair
With spring he felt rejuvenated:
The cell in which he'd hibernated
So marmot-like through winter's night
The hearth, the double panes shut tight
He quit one sparkling morn and sprinted
Along the Neva's bank by sleigh
On hacked-out bluish ice that lay
Beside the road the sunlight glinted
The rutted snow had turned to slush
But where in such a headlong rush
