Spring rays at last begin to muster
And chase from nearby hills the snow
Whose turbid streams flow down and cluster
To inundate the fields below
And drowsy nature, smiling lightly
Now greets the dawning season brightly
The heavens sparkle now with blue
The still transparent woods renew
Their downy green and start to thicken
The bee flies out from waxen cell
To claim its meed from field and dell
The vales grow dry and colours quicken
The cattle low, and by the moon
The nightingale pours forth its tune
