'The morning star will gleam tomorrow
And brilliant day begin to bloom
While I, perhaps, descend in sorrow
The secret refuge of the tomb. . .
Slow Lethe, then, with grim insistence
Will drown my memory's brief existence
Of me the world shall soon grow dumb
But thou, fair maiden, wilt thou come!
To shed a tear in desolation
And think at my untimely grave:
He loved me and for me he gave
His mournful life in consecration!
.
Beloved friend, sweet friend, I wait
Oh, come, Oh, come, I am thy mate!'
