40
At the beginning of my story
(In Chapter One, if you recall)
I wanted with Albani's glory
To paint a Petersburg grand ball
But then, by empty dreams deflected
I lost my way and recollected
The feet of ladies known before
In your slim tracks I'll stray no more
O charming feet and mad affliction!
My youth betrayed, it's time to show
More common sense if I'm to grow
To mend my ways in deeds and diction
And cleanse this Chapter Five at last
Of all digressions from the past
