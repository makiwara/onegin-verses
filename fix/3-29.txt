29
A careless drawl, a tiny stutter
Some imprecision of the tongue
Can still produce a lovely flutter
Within this breast no longer young
I lack the strength for true repentance
And Gallicisms in a sentence
Seem sweet as youthful sins remote
Or verse that Bogdanvich wrote
But that will do. My beauty's letter
Must occupy my pen for now
I gave my word, but, Lord I vow,
Retracting it would suit me better
I know that gentle Parny's lays
Are out of fashion nowadays
