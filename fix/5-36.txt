Whist's heroes have by now completed
Eight rubbers
and eight times as well
They've shifted round and been reseated
Now tea is brought
I like to tell
The time of day by teas and dinners
By supper's call
We country sinners
Can tell the time without great fuss:
The stomach serves as clock for us
And apropos, I might make mention
In passing that I speak as much
Of feasts and foods and corks and such
In these odd lines of my invention
As you, great Homer, you whose song
Has lasted thirty centuries long!

But tea is brought: the girls demurely
Have scarcely taken cups in hand
When suddenly from ballroom doorway
Bassoon and flute announce the band
Elated by the music's bouncing
His tea and rum at once renouncing
That Paris of the local towns
Good Petushkv, to Olga bounds
To Tanya, Lensky
Harlikva
A maiden somewhat ripe in glow
My Tambov poet takes in tow
Buynov whirls off Pustyakva
Then all the crowd comes pouring in
To watch the brilliant ballroom spin
