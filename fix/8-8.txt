'Is he the same, or is he learning?
Or does he play the outcast still?
In what new guise is he returning?
What role does he intend to fill?
Childe Harold?
Melmoth for a while?
Cosmopolite?
A Slavophile?
A Quaker?
Bigot?might one ask?
Or will he sport some other mask?
Or maybe he's just dedicated
Like you and me, to being nice?
In any case, here's my advice:
Give up a role when it's outdated
He's gulled the world . .
now let it go.'
'You know him then?'
'Well, yes and no.'
