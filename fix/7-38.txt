Farewell now, scene of fame unsteady
Petrvsky Castle
Hey!
Be fleet!
There gleam the city gates already!
And now along Tverskya Street
The sleigh glides over ruts and passes
By sentry booths and peasant lasses
By gardens, mansions, fashion shops
Past urchins, streetlamps, strolling fops
Bokhrins, sleighs, apothecaries
Muzhiks and merchants, Cossack guards
Past towers, hovels, boulevards
Great balconies and monasteries
Past gateway lions' lifted paws
And crosses dense with flocks of daws
(39)40
This tiring trek through town extended
For two full hours
then, quite late
Nearby St Chariton's it ended
Before a mansion's double gate
For now they'll seek accommodation
With Tanya's aunt, a kind relation
Four years consumptive, sad to note
In glasses and a torn old coat
A grizzled Kalmuk came to meet them
With sock in hand he led the way
To where the prostrate princess lay
She called from parlour couch to greet them
The two old ladies hugged and cried
With shouts of joy on either side
