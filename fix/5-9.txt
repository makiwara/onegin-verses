9
A frosty night, the sky resplendent
As heaven's galaxy shines down
And glidesso peaceful and transcendent. . .
Tatyana, in her low-cut gown
Steps out of doors and trains a mirror
Upon the moon to bring it nearer
But all that shows in her dark glass
Is just the trembling moon, alas. . .
What's that... the crunching snow . .
who's coming?!
She flits on tiptoe with a sigh
And asks the stranger passing by
Her voice more soft than reed pipe's humming:
'Oh, what's your name?'
He hurries on
Looks back and answers: 'Agafon.'
