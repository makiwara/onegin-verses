Tatyana's letter lies beside me
And reverently I guard it still
I read it with an ache inside me
And cannot ever read my fill
Who taught her then this soft surrender
This careless gift for waxing tender
This touching whimsy free of art
This raving discourse of the heart
Enchanting, yet so fraught with trouble?
I'll never know
But none the less
I give it here in feeble dress:
A living picture's pallid double
Or Freischutz played with timid skill
By fingers that are learning still
Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
I'm writing you this declaration
What more can I in candour say?
It may be now your inclination T
o scorn me and to turn away
But if my hapless situation
Evokes some pity for my woe
You won't abandon me, I know
I first tried silence and evasion
Believe me, you 'd have never learned
My secret shame, had I discerned
The slightest hope that on occasion
But once a weekI'd see your face
Behold you at our country place
Might hear you speak a friendly greeting
Could say a word to you
and then
Could dream both day and night again
Of but one thing, till our next meeting
They say you like to be alone
And find the country unappealing
We lack, I know, a worldly tone
But still, we welcome you with feeling
Why did you ever come to call?
In this forgotten country dwelling
I'd not have known you then at all
Nor known this bitter heartache's swelling
Perhaps, when time had helped in quelling
The girlish hopes on which I fed
I might have found (who knows?)
another
And been a faithful wife and mother
Contented with the life I led
Another!
No!
In all creation
There's no one else whom I'd adore
The heavens chose my destination
And made me thine for evermore!
My life till now has been a token
In pledge of meeting you, my friend
And in your coming, God has spoken
You'll be my guardian till the end. . .
You filled my dreams and sweetest trances
As yet unseen, and yet so dear
You stirred me with your wondrous glances
Your voice within my soul rang clear. . .
And then the dream came true for me!
When you came in, I seemed to waken
I turned to flame, I felt all shaken
And in my heart I cried: It's he!
And was it you I heard replying
Amid the stillness of the night
Or when I helped the poor and dying
Or turned to heaven, softly crying
And said a prayer to soothe my plight?
And even now, my dearest vision
Did I not see your apparition
Flit softly through this lucent night?
Was it not you who seemed to hover
Above my bed, a gentle lover
To whisper hope and sweet delight?
Are you my angel of salvation
Or hell's own demon of temptation?
Be kind and send my doubts away
For this may all be mere illusion
The things a simple girl would say
While Fate intends no grand conclusion. . .
So be it then!
Henceforth I place
My faith in you and your affection
I plead with tears upon my face
And beg you for your kind protection
You cannot know: I'm so alone
There's no one here to whom I've spoken
My mind and will are almost broken
And I must die without a moan
I wait for you . .
and your decision:
Revive my hopes with but a sign
Or halt this heavy dream of mine
Alas, with well-deserved derision!
I close
I dare not now reread. . .
I shrink with shame and fear
But surely, Your honour's all the pledge
I need, And I submit to it securely
