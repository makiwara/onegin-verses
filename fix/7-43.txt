43
The sick old lady's kindly smile
Left Tanya moved, but she felt sad
Within this strange new domicile
And missed the room she'd always had
In bed, beneath her silken curtain
She lies there sleepless and uncertain
And early church bellswhen they chime
Announcing dawn and working time
Rouse Tanya from her bed to listen
She sits before the windowsill
The darkness wanes, but Tanya still
Can't see her fields and valleys glisten:
She sees an unknown yard instead:
A stable, fence, and kitchen shed
