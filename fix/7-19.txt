Tatyana looks in melting pleasure
At everything around the room
She finds it all a priceless treasure
A painful joy that lifts her gloom
And leaves her languid soul ignited:
The desk, the lamp that stands unlighted
The heap of books, the carpet spread
Before the window on the bed
That semi-light, so pale and solemn
The view outdoorsthe lunar pall
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
The iron bust upon its column
w
ith clouded brow beneath a hat
The arms compressed and folded flat
