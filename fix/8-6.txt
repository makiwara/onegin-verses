And now I seize the first occasion
To show my Muse a grand soire
I watch with jealous trepidation
Her rustic charms on full display
And lo!
my beauty calmly passes
Through ranks of men from highborn classes
Past diplomats and soldier-fops
And haughty dames . .
then calmly stops
To sit and watch the grand procession
The gowns, the talk, the milling mass
The slow parade of guests who pass
Before the hostess in succession
The sombre men who form a frame
Around each painted belle and dame
