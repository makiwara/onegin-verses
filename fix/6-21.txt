21
By chance those verses haven't vanished
I have them, and I quote them here:
'Ah, whither, whither are ye banished
My springtime's golden days so dear?
What fate will morning bring my lyre?
In vain my searching eyes enquire
For all lies veiled in misty dust
No matter
fate's decree is just
And whether, pierced
I fall anointed
Or arrow passes byall's right:
The hours of waking and of night
Come each in turn as they're appointed
And blest with all its cares the day
And blest the dark that comes to stay!
