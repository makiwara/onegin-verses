How early on he could dissemble
Conceal his hopes, play jealous swain
Compel belief, or make her tremble,
Seem cast in gloom or mute with pain
Appear so proud or so forbearing
At times attentive, then uncaring!
What languor when his lips were sealed
What fiery art his speech revealed!
What casual letters he would send her!
He lived, he breathed one single dream
How self-oblivious he could seem!
How keen his glance, how bold and tender
And when he wished, he'd make appear
The quickly summoned, glistening tear!
