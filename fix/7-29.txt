29
And all that final summer season
Her walks were long
a brook or knoll
Would stop her now for no good reason
Except to charm her thirsting soul
As with old friends, she keeps returning
To all her groves and meadows, yearning
To talk once more and say goodbye
But quickly summer seems to fly
The golden autumn now arriving
Now nature, tremulous, turns pale
A victim draped in lavish veil. . .
The North now howls, the winds are driving
The clouds before them far and near:
That sorceress the winter's here!
