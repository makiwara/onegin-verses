32
The letter trembles in her fingers
By turns Tatyana groans and sighs
The rosy sealing wafer lingers
Upon her fevered tongue and dries
Her head is bowed, as if she's dozing
Her light chemise has slipped, exposing
Her lovely shoulder to the night
But now the moonbeams' glowing light
Begins to fade
The vale emerges
Above the mist
And now the stream
In silver curves begins to gleam
The shepherd's pipe resounds and urges
The villager to rise
It's morn!
My Tanya, though, is so forlorn
