Adriatic!
Grand Creation!
O Brenta!
I shall yet rejoice
When, filled once more with inspiration
I hear at last your magic voice!
It's sacred to Apollo's choir
Through Albion's great and haughty lyre
It speaks to me in words I know
On soft Italian nights I'll go
In search of pleasure's sweet profusion
A fair Venetian at my side
Now chatting, now a silent guide
I'll float in gondola's seclusion
And she my willing lips will teach
Both love's and Petrarch's ardent speech
