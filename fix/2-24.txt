Her sister bore the name Tatyana
And we now press our wilful claim
To be the first who thus shall honour
A tender novel with that name
Why not?
I like its intonation
It has, I know, association
With olden days beyond recall
With humble roots and servants' hall
But we must grant, though it offend us:
Our taste in names is less than weak
(Of verses I won't even speak)
Enlightenment has failed to mend us
And all we've learned from its great store
Is affectationnothing more
