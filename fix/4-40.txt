Our northern summers, though, are versions
Of southern winters, this is clear
And though we're loath to cast aspersions
They seem to go before they're here!
The sky breathed autumn, turned and darkled
The friendly sun less often sparkled
The days grew short and as they sped
The wood with mournful murmur shed
Its wondrous veil to stand uncovered
The fields all lay in misty peace
The caravan of cackling geese
Turned south and all around there hovered
The sombre season near at hand
November marched across the land
