Was this the Tanya he once scolded
In that forsaken, distant place
Where first our novel's plot unfolded?
The one to whom, when face to face
In such a burst of moral fire
He'd lectured gravely on desire?
The girl whose letter he still kept
In which a maiden heart had wept
Where all was shown ... all unprotected?
Was this that girl... or did he dream?
That little girl whose warm esteem
And humble lot he'd once rejected?
.
And could she now have been so bold
So unconcerned with him ... so cold?
