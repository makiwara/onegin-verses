The fall that year was in no hurry
And nature seemed to wait and wait
For winter. Then, in January
The second night, the snow fell late
Next day as dawn was just advancing
Tatyana woke and, idly glancing
Beheld outdoors a wondrous sight:
The roofs, the yard, the fenceall white
Each pane a fragile pattern showing
The trees in winter silver dyed
Gay magpies on the lawn outside
And all the hilltops soft and glowing
With winter's brilliant rug of snow
The world all fresh and white below
