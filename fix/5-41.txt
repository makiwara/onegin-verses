41
Monotonous and mad procession
Young life's own whirlwind, full of sound
Each pair a blur in quick succession
The rousing waltz goes whirling round
His moment of revenge beginning
Eugene, with secret malice grinning
Approaches Olga . . idly jests
Then spins her round before the guests
He stays beside her when she's seated
Proceeds to talk of this and that
Two minutes barely has she sat. .
And then their waltzing is repeated!
The guests all stare in mute surprise
Poor Lensky can't believe his eyes
