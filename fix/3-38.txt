38
And all the while her soul was aching
Her brimming eyes could hardly see
Then sudden hoofbeats! Now she's quaking...
They're closer... coming here... it's he!
Onegin! 'Oh!' And light as air
She's out the backway, down the stair
From porch to yard, to garden straight
She runs, she flies, she dare not wait
To glance behind her, on she pushes
Past garden plots, small bridges, lawn
The lakeway path, the wood, and on
She flies and breaks through lilac bushes
Past seedbeds to the brook, so fast
That, panting, on a bench at last
