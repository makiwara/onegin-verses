Ah, wintertime!
.
The peasant, cheerful
Creates a passage with his sleigh
Aware of snow, his nag is fearful
But shambles somehow down the way
A bold kibitka skips and burrows
And ploughs a trail of fluffy furrows
The driver sits behind the dash
In sheepskin coat and scarlet sash
And here's a household boy gone sleighing
His Blackie seated on the sled
While he plays horse and runs ahead
The rascal froze his fingers, playing
And laughs out loud between his howls
While through the glass his mother scowls
