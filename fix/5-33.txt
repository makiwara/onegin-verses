The bottle pops as cork goes flying
The fizzing wine comes gushing fast
And now with solemn mien, and dying
To have his couplet heard at last
Triquet stands up, the congregation
Falls silent in anticipation
Tatyana's scarce alive. Triquet
With verse in hand, looks Tanya's way
And starts to sing, off-key. Loud cheering
And claps salute him. Tanya feels
Constrained to curtsey . . almost reels
The bard, whose modesty's endearing
Is first to toast her where he stands
Then puts his couplet in her hands
