'My uncle, man of firm convictions . .
By falling gravely ill, he's won
A due respect for his afflictions
The only clever thing he's done
May his example profit others
But God, what deadly boredom, brothers
To tend a sick man night and day
Not daring once to steal away!
And, oh, how base to pamper grossly
And entertain the nearly dead
To fluff the pillows for his head
And pass him medicines morosely
While thinking under every sigh:
The devil take you, Uncle Die!'
