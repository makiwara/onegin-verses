Tatyana watches, fascinated
The molten wax submerge and turn
To wondrous shapes which designated
Some wondrous thing that she would learn
Then from a basin filled with water
Their rings are drawn in random order
When Tanya's ring turned up at last
The song they sang was from the past:
''The peasants there have hoards of treasure
They spade up silver from a ditch!
The one we sing to will be rich
And famous!' But the plaintive measure
Foretells a death to come ere long
And girls prefer 'The Kitty's Song.'
