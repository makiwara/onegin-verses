His unexpected reappearance
That momentary tender look
The strangeness of his interference
With Olgaall confused and shook
Tatyana's soul. His true intention
Remained beyond her comprehension
And jealous anguish pierced her breast
As if a chilling hand had pressed
Her heart, as if in awful fashion
A rumbling, black abyss did yawn.
'I'll die,' she whispers to the dawn
'But death from him is sweet compassion
Why murmur vainly? He can't give
The happiness for which I live.'
