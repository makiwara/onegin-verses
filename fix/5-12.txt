As at a vexing separation
Tatyana murmured, at a loss
She saw no friendly soul on station
To lend a hand to help her cross
But suddenly a snowbank shifted
And who emerged when it was lifted?
A huge and matted bear appeared!
Tatyana screamed!
He growled and reared
Then stretched a paw . .
sharp claws abhorrent
To Tanya, who could barely stand
She took it with a trembling hand
And worked her way across the torrent
With apprehensive step . .
then fled!
The bear just followed where she led
