But from that band I soon departed
And fled afar . .
and she as well
How often, on the course I charted
My gentle Muse's magic spell
Would light the way with secret stories!
How oft, mid far Caucasia's glories
Like fair Lenore, on moonlit nights
She rode with me those craggy heights!
How often on the shores of Tauris
On misty eves, she led me down
To hear the sea's incessant sound
The Nereids' eternal chorus
That endless chant the waves unfurled
In praise of him who made the world
