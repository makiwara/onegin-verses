But even friendships like our heroes
Exist no more for we've outgrown
All sentiments and deem men zeros
Except of course ourselves alone
We all take on Napoleon's features
And millions of our fellow creatures
Are nothing more to us than tools . .
Since feelings are for freaks and fools
Eugene, of course, had keen perceptions
And on the whole despised mankind
Yet wasn't, like so many, blind
And since each rule permits exceptions
He did respect a noble few
And, cold himself, gave warmth its due
