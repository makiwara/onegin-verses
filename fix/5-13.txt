She dare not look to see behind her
And ever faster on she reels
At every turn he seems to find her
That shaggy footman at her heels!
The grunting, loathesome bear still lumbers
Before them now a forest slumbers
The pines in all their beauty frown
And barely stir, all weighted down
By clumps of snow, and through the summits
Of naked linden, birch, and ash
The beams from heaven's lanterns flash
There is no path,the gorge that plummets
The shrubs, the land ... all lie asleep
By snowy blizzards buried deep
