37
And here's Petrvsky Castle, hoary
Amid its park
In sombre dress
It wears with pride its recent glory:
Napoleon, drunk with fresh success
Awaited here, in vain, surrender
For kneeling Moscow's hand to tender
The ancient Kremlin's hallowed keys
But Moscow never bent her knees
Nor bowed her head in subjugation
No welcome feast did she prepare
The restless hero waiting there
But lit instead a conflagration
From here he watched, immersed in thought
The awesome blaze my Moscow wrought
