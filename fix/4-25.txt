25
Each passing hour more captivated
By Olga's winning, youthful charms
Vladimir gave his heart and waited
To serve sweet bondage with his arms
He's ever near
In gloomy weather
They sit in Olga's room together
Or arm in arm they make their rounds
Each morning through the park and grounds
And so?
Inebriated lover
Confused with tender shame the while
(Encouraged, though, by Olga's smile)
He sometimes even dares to cover
One loosened curl with soft caress
Or kiss the border of her dress
