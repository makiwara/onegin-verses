Now the mazurka's call is sounded
Its thunder once could even rack
The greatest hall when it resounded
And under heels parquet would crack
The very windows shook like Hades
But now it's changed: we're all like ladies
And o'er the lacquered boards we glide
But in small town and countryside
The old mazurka hasn't faltered
It still retains its pristine joys:
Moustaches, leaps, heel-pounding noise
Remain the same
they've not been altered
By tyrant-fashion's high decrees
The modern Russian's new disease

My bold Buynov guides expertly
Tatyana to our hero's side
And Olga too
Eugene alertly
Makes off with Lensky's future bride
He steers her, gliding nonchalantly
And bending, whispers her gallantly
Some common madrigal to please
Then gives her hand a gentle squeeze
She blushes in appreciation
Her prim conceited face alight
While Lensky rages at the sight
Consumed with jealous indignation
He waits till the mazurka's through
Then asks her for the dance he's due
