The night has countless stars to light her
And Moscow countless beauties too
And yet the regal moon shines brighter
Than all her friends in heaven's blue
And she, whose beauty I admire
But dare not bother with my lyre
Just like the moon upon her throne
Mid wives and maidens shines alone
With what celestial pride she grazes
The earth she walks, in splendour dressed!
What languor fills her lovely breast!
How sensuous her wondrous gazes!
.
But there, enough
have done at last:
You've paid your due to follies past
