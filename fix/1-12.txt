How early he could stir or worry
The hearts of even skilled coquettes!
And when he found it necessary
To crush a rivaloh, what nets
What clever traps he'd set before him!
And how his wicked tongue would gore him!
But you, you men in wedded bliss
You stayed his friends despite all this:
The crafty husband fawned and chuckled
(Faublas' disciple and his tool)
As did the skeptical old fool
And the majestic, antlered cuckold
So pleased with all he had in life:
Himself, his dinner, and his wife
(13-14) 15
Some mornings still abed he drowses
Until his valet brings his tray
What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
Have asked him to a grand soire
There'll be a ball, a children's party
Where will he dash to, my good hearty?
Where will he make the night's first call?
Oh, never mindhe'll make them all
But meanwhile, dressed for morning pleasure
Bedecked in broad-brimmed Bolivar
He drives to Nevsky Boulevard
To stroll about at total leisure
Until Brguet's unsleeping chime
Reminds him that it's dinner time
