How early he could stir or worry
The hearts of even skilled coquettes!
And when he found it necessary
To crush a rivaloh, what nets
What clever traps he'd set before him!
And how his wicked tongue would gore him!
But you, you men in wedded bliss
You stayed his friends despite all this:
The crafty husband fawned and chuckled
(Faublas' disciple and his tool)
As did the skeptical old fool
And the majestic, antlered cuckold
So pleased with all he had in life:
Himself, his dinner, and his wife
