But dolls were never Tanya's passion
When she was small she didn't choose
To talk to them of clothes or fashion
Or tell them all the city news
And she was not the sort who glories
In girlish pranks
but grisly stories
Quite charmed her heart when they were told
On winter nights all dark and cold
Whenever nanny brought together
Young Olga's friends to spend the day
Tatyana never joined their play
Or games of tag upon the heather
For she was bored by all their noise
Their laughing shouts and giddy joys
