There was a time when breezes playing
Among the pines would gently turn
A secret wreath that hung there swaying
Upon a bough above that urn
And sometimes in the evening hours
Two maidens used to come with flowers
And by the moonlit grave they kept
Their vigil and, embracing, wept
But now the monument stands dreary
And quite forgot
Its pathway now
All weeds
No wreath is on the bough
Alone the shepherd, grey and weary
Beneath it sings as in the past
and plaits his simple shoes of bast

My poor, poor Lensky!
Yes, she mourned him
Although her tears were all too brief!
Alas!
His fiance has scorned him
And proved unfaithful to her grief
Another captured her affection
Another with his love's perfection
Has lulled her wretchedness to sleep:
A lancer has enthralled her deep
A lancer whom she loves with passion
And at the altar by his side
She stands beneath the crown a bride
Her head bent down in modest fashion
Her lowered eyes aflame the while
And on her lips a slender smile
