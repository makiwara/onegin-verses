'Can it be true?'
Eugene reflected
'Can that be she?
It seems . .
and yet. .
From those backwoods!'
And he directed
A curious and keen lorgnette
For several minutes in succession
Upon the lady whose expression
Called up a face from long ago
'But tell me, Prince, you wouldn't know
Who's standing there in conversation
Beside the Spanish envoy, pray
That lady in the red beret?'
'You have been out of circulation
But I'll present you now with joy.'
'Who is she, though?'
'My wife, old boy.'
