Where hills half circle round a valley
Let's trace a winding brooklet's flow
Through greening fields, and watch it dally
Beside a spot where lindens grow
And there the nightingale, spring's lover
Sings out till dawn, a crimson cover
Of briar blooms, and freshets sound
There too a tombstone can be found
Beneath two pine trees, old for ages
Its legend lets the stranger know:
'Vladimir Lensky lies below
He died too soon ... his death courageous
At such an age, in such a year
Repose in peace, young poet, here!'
