53
Commotion, bows . . . the glad, the solemn . .
Galop, mazurka, waltz. . . And there
Between two aunts, beside a column
Observed by none, and near despair
Tatyana looks with eyes unseeing
And loathes this world with all her being
She's stifled here . . and in her mind
Calls up the life she left behind
The countryside, poor village neighbours
A distant and secluded nook
Beside a limpid flowing brook
Her flowers, novels, daily labours
That dusky, linden-shaded walk
Where he and she once had their talk
