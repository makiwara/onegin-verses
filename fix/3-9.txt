And now with what great concentration
To tender novels she retreats
With what a vivid fascination
Takes in their ravishing deceits!
Those figures fancy has created
Her happy dreams have animated:
The lover of Julie Wolmr
Malk-Adhl and de Linr
And Werther, that rebellious martyr
And Grandison, the noble lord
(With whom today we're rather bored)
All these our dreamy maiden's ardour
Has pictured with a single grace
And seen in all. .
