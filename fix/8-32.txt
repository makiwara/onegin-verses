But he refused to go
He's ready
To join his forebears any day
Tatyana, though, stayed calm and steady
(Their sex, alas, is hard to sway)
And yet he's stubborn . .
still resistant
Still hopeful and indeed persistent
Much bolder than most healthy men
He chose with trembling hand to pen
The princess an impassioned letter
Though on the whole he saw no sense
In missives writ in love's defence
(And with good cause!)
he found it better
Than bearing all his pain unheard
So here's his letter word for word
Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
I know you'll feel a deep distress
At this unwanted revelation
What hitter scorn and condemnation
Your haughty glance may well express!
What aims . .
what hopes do
I envision In opening my soul to you?
What wicked and deserved derision
Perhaps I give occasion to!
When first I met you and detected
A warmth in you quite unexpected
I dared not trust in love again:
I didn 't yield to sweet temptation
And had, it's true, no inclination
To lose my hateful freedom then
What's more: poor guiltless Lensky perished
And his sad fate drew us apart
From all that I had ever cherished
I tore away my grieving heart
Estranged from men and discontented
I thought: in freedom, peace of mind
A substitute for joy I'd find
How wrong I've been!
And how tormented!
But no!
Each moment of my days
To see you and pursue you madly!
To catch your smile and search your gaze
With loving eyes that seek you gladly
To melt with pain before your face
To hear your voice. . . to try to capture
With all my soul your perfect grace
To swoon and pass away . .
what rapture!
And I'm deprived of this
for you
I search on all the paths I wander
Each day is dear, each moment too!
Yet I in futile dullness squander
These days allotted me by fate
Oppressive days indeed of late
My span on earth is all but taken
But lest too soon I join the dead
I need to know when I awaken
I'll see you in the day ahead
I fear that in this meek petition
Your solemn gaze may only spy
The cunning of a base ambition
And I can hear your stern reply
But if you knew the anguish in it:
To thirst with love in every part
To burnand with the mind each minute
To calm the tumult in one's heart
To long to clasp in adoration
Your knees . .
and, sobbing at your feet
Pour out confessions, lamentation
Oh, all that I might then entreat!
And meantime, feigning resignation
To arm my gaze and speech with lies:
to look at you with cheerful eyes
And hold a placid conversation!
.
But let it be: it's now too late
For me to struggle at this hour
The die is cast: I'm in your power
And I surrender to my fate
