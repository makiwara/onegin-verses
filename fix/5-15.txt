She sinks in snow
the bear alertly
Just picks her up and rushes on
She lies within his arms inertly
Her breathing stops, all sense is gone
Along a forest road he surges
And then, mid trees, a hut emerges
Dense brush abounds
on every hand
Forlorn and drifting snowbanks stand
A tiny window glitters brightly
And from the hut come cries and din
The bear proclaims: 'My gossip's in.'
'Come warm yourself,' he adds politely
Then pushes straightway through the door
And lays her down upon the floor
