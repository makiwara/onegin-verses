It's true!
The lady didn't shiver
Or blush, or suddenly turn white
Or even let an eyebrow quiver
Or press her lips together tight
Although Eugene with care inspected
This placid lady, he detected
No trace of Tanya from the past
And when he tried to speak at last
He found he couldn't
She enquired
When he'd arrived, and if of late
he'd been back home at his estate
Then gave her spouse a look so tired
He took her arm
She moved away . .
And left Eugene in mute dismay
