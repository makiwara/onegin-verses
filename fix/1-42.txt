Capricious belles of lofty station!
You were the first that he forswore
For nowadays in our great nation
The manner grand can only bore
I wouldn't say that ladies never
Discuss a Say or Benthamever
But generally, you'll have to grant
Their talk's absurd, if harmless, cant
On top of which, they're so unerring
So dignified, so awfully smart
So pious and so chaste of heart
So circumspect, so strict in bearing
So inaccessibly serene
Mere sight of them brings on the spleen
