Her dream disturbs her, and not knowing
What secret message she'd been sent
Tatyana seeks some passage showing
Just what the dreadful vision meant
She finds in alphabetic order
What clues the index can afford her:
There's bear and blizzard, bridge, and crow
Fir, forest, hedgehog, night, and snow
And many more
But her confusion
Martyn Zadck cannot dispel
The frightful vision must foretell
Sad times to come and disillusion
For several days she couldn't find
A way to calm her troubled mind
