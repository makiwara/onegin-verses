It may be he was born to fire
The world with good, or earn at least
A gloried name
his silenced lyre
Might well have raised, before it ceased
A call to ring throughout the ages
Perhaps, upon the world's great stages
He might have scaled a lofty height
His martyred shade, condemned to night
Perhaps has carried off forever
Some sacred truth, a living word
Now doomed by death to pass unheard
And in the tomb his shade shall never
Receive our race's hymns of praise
Nor hear the ages bless his days
(38) 39
Or maybe he was merely fated
To live amid the common tide
And as his years of youth abated
The flame within him would have died
In time he might have changed profoundly
Have quit the Muses, married soundly
And in the country he'd have worn
A quilted gown and cuckold's horn
And happy, he'd have learned life truly
At forty he'd have had the gout
Have eaten, drunk, grown bored and stout
And so decayed, until he duly
Passed on in bed ... his children round
While women wept and doctors frowned
