But what's the point? I'd like to know it
Perhaps, my friends, by fate's decree
I'll cease one day to be a poet
When some new demon seizes me
And scorning then Apollo's ire
To humble prose I'll bend my lyre:
A novel in the older vein
Will claim what happy days remain
No secret crimes or passions gory
Shall I in grim detail portray
But simply tell as best I may
A Russian family's age-old story
A tale of lovers and their lot
Of ancient customs unforgot
