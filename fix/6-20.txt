20
On coming home, the youth inspected
His pistols, then he put them back
Undressed, by candle he selected
A book of Schiller's from the rack
But only one bright image holds him
One thought within his heart enfolds him:
He sees before him, wondrous fair
His incandescent Olga there
He shuts the book and, with decision
Takes up his pen. . . His verses ring
With all the nonsense lovers sing
And feverish with lyric vision
He reads them out like one possessed
Like drunken Delvig at a fest!
