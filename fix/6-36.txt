36
You mourn the poet, friends . . and rightly:
Scarce out of infant clothes and killed!
Those joyous hopes that bloomed so brightly
Now doomed to wither unfulfilled!
Where now the ardent agitation
The fine and noble aspiration
Of youthful feeling, youthful thought
Exalted, tender, boldly wrought?
And where are stormy love's desires
The thirst for knowledge, work, and fame
The dread of vice, the fear of shame?
And where are you, poetic fires
You cherished dreams of sacred worth
And pledge of life beyond this earth!
