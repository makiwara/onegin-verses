But my Eugene all evening heeded
Tatyana . .
only her alone:
But not the timid maid who'd pleaded
That poor enamoured girl he'd known
But this cool princess so resplendent
This distant goddess so transcendent
Who ruled the queenly Neva's shore
Alas!
We humans all ignore
Our Mother Eve's disastrous history:
What's given to us ever palls
Incessantly the serpent calls
And lures us to the tree of mystery:
We've got to have forbidden fruit
Or Eden's joys for us are moot
