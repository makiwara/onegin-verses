Poor Lensky! In his place of resting
In deaf eternity's grim shade
Did he, sad bard, awake protesting
The fateful news, he'd been betrayed?
Or lulled by Lethe, has he slumbered
His blissful spirit unencumbered
By feelings and perturbed no more
His world a closed and silent door?
Just so! The tomb that lies before us
Holds but oblivion in the end
The voice of lover, foe, and friend
Falls silent fast. Alone the chorus
Of angry heirs in hot debate
Contests obscenely our estate
