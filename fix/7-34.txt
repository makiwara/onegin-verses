34
But roads are bad now in our nation
Neglected bridges rot and fall
Bedbugs and fleas at every station
Won't let the traveller sleep at all
No inns exist. At posting stages
They hang pretentious menu pages
But just for show, as if to spite
The traveller's futile appetite
While some rude Cyclops at his fire
Treats Europe's dainty artefacts
With mighty Russian hammer whacks
And thanks the Lord for ruts and mire
And all the ditches that abound
Throughout our native Russian ground
