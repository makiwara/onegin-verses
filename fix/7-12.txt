Soon Olga's happy voice and beauty
No longer cheered the family group
A captive of his lot and duty
Her lancer had to join his troop
Dame Larin's eyes began to water
As she embraced her younger daughter
And, scarce alive, cried out goodbye
But Tanya found she couldn't cry
A deathly pallor merely covered
Her stricken face, When all came out
Onto the porch and fussed about
While taking leave, Tatyana hovered
Beside the couple's coach below
Then sadly saw the lovers go
