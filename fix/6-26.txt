Impatient, but in no great panic
Vladimir waited near the dam
Meanwhile Zaretsky, born mechanic
Was carping at the millstone's cam
Onegin, late, made explanation
Zaretsky frowned in consternation:
'Good God, man, where's your second?
Where?'
In duels a purist doctrinaire
Zaretsky favoured stout reliance
On proper form
he'd not allow
Dispatching chaps just anyhow
But called for strict and full compliance
With rules, traditions, ancient ways
(Which we, of course, in him should praise)
