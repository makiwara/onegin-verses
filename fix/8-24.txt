The social cream had gathered gaily:
The nobly born and fashion's pets
The faces one encounters daily
The fools one never once forgets
The aged ladies, decked in roses
In bonnets and malignant poses
And several maidens, far from gay
Unsmiling faces on display
And here's an envoy speaking slyly
Of some most solemn state affair
A greybeard too . .
with scented hair
Who joked both cleverly and wryly
In quite a keen, old-fashioned way
Which seems a touch absurd today!
