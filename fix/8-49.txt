49
Whatever, reader, your reaction
and whether you be foe or friend
I hope we part in satisfaction. .
As comrades now
Whatever end
You may have sought in these reflections
Tumultuous, fond recollections
Relief from labours for a time
Live images, or wit in rhyme
Or maybe merely faulty grammar
God grant that in my careless art
For fun, for dreaming, for the heart. .
For raising journalistic clamour
You've found at least a crumb or two
And so let's part
farewell. .
adieu!
