55
But I was born for peaceful roaming
For country calm and lack of strife
My lyre sings! And in the gloaming
My fertile fancies spring to life
I give myself to harmless pleasures
And far niente rules my leisures:
Each morning early I'm awake
To wander by the lonely lake
Or seek some other sweet employment:
I read a little, often sleep
For fleeting fame I do not weep
And was it not in past enjoyment
Of shaded, idle times like this
I spent my days of deepest bliss?
