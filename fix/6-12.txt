12
At home the poet, seething, paces
And waits impatiently to hear
Then in his babbling neighbour races
The answer in his solemn leer
The jealous poet's mood turned festive!
He'd been, till now, uncertain. . restive
Afraid the scoundrel might refuse
Or laugh it off and, through some ruse
Escape unscathed ... the slippery devil!
But now at last his doubts were gone:
Next day, for sure, they'd drive at dawn
Out to the mill, where each would level
A pistol, cocked and lifted high
To aim at temple or at thigh
