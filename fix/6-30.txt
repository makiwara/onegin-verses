'Approach at will!'
Advancing coldly
With quiet, firm, and measured tread
Not aiming yet, the foes took boldly
The first four steps that lay ahead
Four fateful steps
The space decreasing
Onegin then, while still not ceasing
His slow advance, was first to raise
His pistol with a level gaze
Five paces more, while Lensky waited
To close one eye and, only then
To take his aim. . .
And that was when
Onegin fired!
The hour fated
Has struck at last: the poet stops
And silently his pistol drops
