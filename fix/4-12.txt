Some moments passed in utter quiet
And then Eugene approached and spoke:
'You wrote to me
Do not deny it
I've read your words and they evoke
My deep respect for your emotion
Your trusting soul. .
and sweet devotion
Your candour has a great appeal
And stirs in me, I won't conceal
Long dormant feelings, scarce remembered
But I've no wish to praise you now
Let me repay you with a vow
As artless as the one you tendered
Hear my confession too, I plead
And judge me both by word and deed
