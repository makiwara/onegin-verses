The good old lady was delighted
To hear such sensible advice
She checked her funds and then decided
A Moscow winter would be nice
Tatyana heard the news morosely
The haughty world would watch her closely
And judge her harshly from the start:
Her simple, open country heart
And country dress would find no mercy
And antiquated turns of phrase
Were sure to bring a mocking gaze
From every Moscow fop and Circe!
O  horrors! No, she'd better stay
Safe in her woods and never stray
