Enchanted land! There for a season
That friend of freedom ruled the scene
The daring satirist Fonvizin
As did derivative Knyazhnin
There Ozerov received the nation's
Unbidden tears and its ovations
Which young Semynova did share
And our Katnin gave us there
Corneille's full genius resurrected
And there the caustic Shakhovsky
Refreshed the stage with comic joy
Didelot his crown of fame perfected
There too, beneath the theatre's tent
My fleeting, youthful days were spent
