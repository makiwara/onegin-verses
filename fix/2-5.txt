At first the neighbours' calls were steady
But when they learned that in the rear
Onegin kept his stallion ready
So he could quickly disappear
The moment one of them was sighted
Or heard approaching uninvited
They took offence and, one and all
They dropped him cold and ceased to call
'The man's a boor, he's off his rocker.'
'Must be a Mason drinks, they say . .
Red wine, by tumbler, night and day!' '
Won't kiss a lady's hand, the mocker.'
'Won't call me "sir" the way he should
' The general verdict wasn't good
