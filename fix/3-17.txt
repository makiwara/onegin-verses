nurse, it's stifling!
Put up the window ... sit by me.'
'What ails you, Tanya?''
Life's so trifling
Come tell me how it used to be.'
'Well, what about it?
Lord, it's ages. .
I must have known a thousand pages
Of ancient facts and fables too
'Bout evil ghosts and girls like you
But nowadays I'm not so canny
I can't remember much of late
Oh, Tanya, it's a sorry state
I get confused .
' 'But tell me, nanny
About the olden days . .
you know
Were you in love then, long ago?'
