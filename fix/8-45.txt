45
'I'm weeping. . .
Oh, at this late hour
If you recall your Tanya still
Then knowthat were it in my power
I'd much prefer words harsh and chill
Stern censure in your former fashion
To this offensive show of passion
To all these letters and these tears
Oh then at least, my tender years
Aroused in you some hint of kindness
You pitied then my girlish dreams. . .
But now!
.
What unbecoming schemes
Have brought you to my feet?
What blindness!
Can you, so strong of mind and heart
Now stoop to play so base a part?
