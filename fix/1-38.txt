38
We still, alas, cannot forestall it
This dreadful ailment's heavy toll
The spleen is what the English call it
We call it simply Russian soul
'Twas this our hero had contracted
And though, thank God, he never acted
To put a bullet through his head
His former love of life was dead
Like Byron's Harold, lost in trances
Through drawing rooms he'd pass and stare
But neither whist, nor gossip there
Nor wanton sighs, nor tender glances
No, nothing touched his sombre heart
He noticed nothing, took no part
