All's quiet now. Inside the parlour
The portly Mr. Pustyakov
Lies snoring with his portly partner
Gvozdin, Buynov, Petushkov
And Flynov, who'd been reeling badly-
On dining chairs have bedded gladly
While on the floor Triquet's at rest
In tattered nightcap and his vest
The rooms of Olga and Tatyana
Are filled with girls in sleep's embrace
Alone, beside the windowcase
Illumined sadly by Diana
Poor Tanya, sleepless and in pain
Sits gazing at the darkened plain
