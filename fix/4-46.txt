But all that foamy, frothy wheezing
Just plays my stomach false
I fear
And nowadays I find more pleasing
Sedate Bordeaux's good quiet cheer
Ai I find is much too risky
A is like a mistressfrisky
Vivacious, brilliant. .
and too light
But you, Bordeaux, I find just right
You're like a comrade, ever steady
Prepared in trials or in grief
To render service, give relief
And when we wish it, always ready
To share a quiet evening's end
Long live Bordeaux, our noble friend!
