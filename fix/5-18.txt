He gives a signthe others hustle
He drinksall drink and all grow shrill
He laughsthey all guffaw and bustle
He frownsand all of them grow still
He's master here, there's no mistaking
And Tanya, now no longer quaking
Turns curious to see still more
And pushes slightly on the door. . .
The sudden gust of wind surprises
The band of goblins, putting out
The night-time lanterns all about
His eyes aflame, Onegin rises
And strikes his chair against the floor
All rise
he marches to the door
