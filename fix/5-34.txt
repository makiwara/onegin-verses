Now greetings come, congratulations
Tatyana thanks them for the day
But when Eugene's felicitations
Came due in turn, the girl's dismay
Her weariness and helpless languor
Evoked his pity more than anger:
He bowed to her in silence, grave . .
But somehow just the look he gave
Was wondrous tender
If asserting
Some feeling for Tatyana's lot
Or if, unconsciously or not
He'd only teased her with some flirting
His look was still a tender dart:
It reawakened Tanya's heart
