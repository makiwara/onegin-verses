'Tatyana's name-day celebration
Is Saturday. Her mother's sent
(And Olga too!) an invitation
Now don't refuse, it's time you went.'
'There'll be a crush and lots of babble
And all that crowd of local rabble.'
'Why not at all, they just intend
To have the family, that's all, friend
Come on, let's go, do me the favour!'
'Alright, I'll go.' 'Well done, first class!'
And with these words he drained his glass
In toast to his attractive neighbour . .
And then waxed voluble once more
In talk of Olga. Love's a bore!
