Can she have solved the riddle's power?
Can she have found the final clue?
She hardly notes how late the hour
And back at home she's overdue
Where two old friends in conversation
Speak out on Tanya's situation:
'What can I do? Tatyana's grown,'
Dame Larin muttered with a moan
'Her younger sister married neatly
It's time that she were settled too
I swear I don't know what to do
She turns all offers down completely
Just says: "I can't", then broods away
And wanders through those woods all day.'
