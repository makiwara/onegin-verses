'And how are our dear neighbours faring?
Tatyana and your Olga, pray?'
'Just half a glass, old boy, be sparing. .
The family's well, I think I'd say
They send you greetings and affection...
Oh, God, my friend, what sheer perfection
In Olga's breast! What shoulders too!
And what a soul! Come visit, do!
You ought to, really... they'll be flattered
Or judge yourself how it must look
You dropped in twice and closed the book
Since then, it seems, they've hardly mattered
In fact... Good Lord, my wits are bleak!
You've been invited there next week!'
