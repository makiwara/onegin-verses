I have no leisure for retailing
The sum of all our hero's parts
But where his genius proved unfailing
The thing he'd learned above all arts
What from his prime had been his pleasure
His only torment, toil, and treasure
What occupied, the livelong day
His languid spirit's fretful play
Was love itself, the art of ardour
Which Ovid sang in ages past
And for which song he paid at last
By ending his proud days a martyr
In dim Moldavia's vacant waste
Far from the Rome his heart embraced
