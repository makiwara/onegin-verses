I have no leisure for retailing
The sum of all our hero's parts
But where his genius proved unfailing
The thing he'd learned above all arts
What from his prime had been his pleasure
His only torment, toil, and treasure
What occupied, the livelong day
His languid spirit's fretful play
Was love itself, the art of ardour
Which Ovid sang in ages past
And for which song he paid at last
By ending his proud days a martyr
In dim Moldavia's vacant waste
Far from the Rome his heart embraced
(9) 10
How early on he could dissemble
Conceal his hopes, play jealous swain
Compel belief, or make her tremble, S
eem cast in gloom or mute with pain
Appear so proud or so forbearing
At times attentive, then uncaring!
What languor when his lips were sealed
What fiery art his speech revealed!
What casual letters he would send her!
He lived, he breathed one single dream
How self-oblivious he could seem!
How keen his glance, how bold and tender
And when he wished, he'd make appear
The quickly summoned, glistening tear!
