Then for a moment chatter ceases
As mouths start chewing
All around
The clink of plates and forks increases
The glasses jingle and resound
But soon the guests are somewhat sated
The hubbub grows more animated . .
But no one hears his neighbour out
All laugh and argue, squeal and shout
The doors fly back
two figures enter
It's Lensky . .
with Eugene!
'Oh dear!'
The hostess cries, 'At last you're here!'
The guests all squeeze toward the centre
Each moves his setting, shifts his chair
And in a trice they seat the pair
