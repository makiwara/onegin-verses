Her husband enters, thus arresting
This most unpleasant tte  â€”  tte
Eugene and he recalled the jesting
The pranks and fun when first they'd met
They laughed
Then guests began arriving
And on the spice of malice thriving
The conversation sparkled bright
The hostess kept the banter light
And quite devoid of affectations
Good reasoned talk was also heard
But not a trite or vulgar word
No lasting truths or dissertations
And no one's ears were shocked a bit
By all the flow of lively wit
