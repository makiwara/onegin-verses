But hush!
A strident critic rises
And bids us cast away the crown
Of elegy in all its guises
And to our rhyming guild calls down:
'Have done with all your lamentations
Your endless croakings and gyrations
On "former days" and "times of yore
Enough now!
Sing of something more!'
You're right
And will you point with praises
To trumpet, mask, and dagger too
And bid us thuswise to renew
Our stock of dead ideas and phrases?
Is that it, friend?
'Far from it
Nay!
Write odes, good sirs, write odes, I say . .
