They take her to the Grand Assembly:
And there the crush, the glare, the heat
The music's roar, the ballroom trembling
The whirling flash of pairs of feet
The beauties in their filmy dresses
The swarming gallery throng that presses
The host of girls on marriage hunts
Assault the senses all at once
Here practised dandies bow and slither
To show their gall. . and waistcoats too
With negligent lorgnettes in view
Hussars on leave come racing hither
To strut their stuff and thunder by
To dazzle, conquer . . and to fly
