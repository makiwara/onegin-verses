50
Will freedom comeand cut my tether?
It's time, it's time! I bid her hail
I roam the shore, await fair weather
And beckon to each passing sail
when, my soul, with waves contesting
And caped in storms, shall I go questing
Upon the crossroads of the sea?
It's time to quit this dreary lee
And land of harsh, forbidding places
And there, where southern waves break high
Beneath my Africa's warm sky
To sigh for sombre Russia's spaces
Where first I loved, where first I wept
And where my buried heart is kept
