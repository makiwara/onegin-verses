46
'To me, Onegin, all these splendours
This weary tinselled life of mine
This homage that the great world tenders
My stylish house where princes dine
Are empty
I'd as soon be trading
This tattered life of masquerading
This world of glitter, fumes, and noise
For just my books, the simple joys
Of our old home, its walks and flowers
For all those haunts that I once knew . .
Where first, Onegin, I saw you
For that small churchyard's shaded bowers
Where over my poor nanny now
there stands a cross beneath a bough
