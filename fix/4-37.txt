But what of our Eugene this while?
Have patience, friends, I beg you, pray
I'll tell it all in detailed style
And show you how he spent each day
Onegin lived in his own heaven:
In summer he'd get up by seven
And, lightly clad, would take a stroll
Down to the stream below the knoll
Gulnare's proud singer his example
He'd swim across this Hellespont
Then afterwards, as was his wont
He'd drink his coffee, sometimes sample
The pages of some dull review
And then he'd dress. . .

Long rambles, reading, slumber's blisses
The burbling brook, the wooded shade
At times the fresh and youthful kisses
Of white-skinned, dark-eyed country maid
A horse of spirit fit to bridle
A dinner fanciful and idle
A bottle of some sparkling wine
Seclusion, quietthese, in fine
Were my Onegin's saintly pleasures
To which he yielded one by one
Unmoved to count beneath the sun
Fair summer's days and careless treasures
Unmindful too of town or friends
And their dull means to festive ends
