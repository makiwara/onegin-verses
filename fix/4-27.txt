27
When he drives home, she still engages
His poet's soul, his artist's mind
He fills her album's fleeting pages
With every tribute he can find:
He draws sweet views of rustic scenery
A Venus temple, graves and greenery
He pens a lyre . .
and then a dove
Adds colour lightly and with love
And on the leaves of recollection
Beneath the lines from other hands
He plants a tender verse that stands
Mute monument to fond reflection:
A moment's thought whose trace shall last
Unchanged when even years have passed
