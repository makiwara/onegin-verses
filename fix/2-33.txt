She used to write, with blood, quotations
In maidens' albums, thought it keen
To speak in singsong intonations
Would call Praskvya 'chre Pauline'
She laced her corset very tightly
Pronounced a Russian n as slightly
As n in French
and through the nose
But soon she dropped her city pose:
The corset, albums, chic relations
The sentimental verses too
Were quite forgot
she bid adieu
To all her foreign affectations
And took at last to coming down
In just her cap and quilted gown
