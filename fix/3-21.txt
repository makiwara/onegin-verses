21
Far off Tatyana ranged in dreaming
Bewitched by moonlight's magic curse. .
And then a sudden thought came gleaming:
'I'd be alone now . .
leave me, nurse
But give me first a pen and paper
I won't be long . .
just leave the taper
Good night.'
She's now alone
All's still
The moonlight shines upon her sill
And propped upon an elbow, writing
Tatyana pictures her Eugene
And in a letter, rash and green
Pours forth a maiden's blameless plighting
The letter's readyall but sent. .
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
