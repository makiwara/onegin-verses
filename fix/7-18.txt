18
'Our neighbour Lensky, lately buried
Would dine with him in winter here
Come this way, please . . but don't feel hurried
And here's the master's study, dear
He slept, took coffee in these quarters
Would hear the bailiff, give his orders
And mornings read some book right through. . .
My former master lived here too
On Sundays at his window station
His glasses on, he'd deign to play
Some cards with me to pass the day
God grant his mortal soul salvation
And may his dear old bones be blest
In Mother Earth where he's at rest.'
