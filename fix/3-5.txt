'But tell me, which one was Tatyana?'
'Why, she who with a wistful air
All sad and silent like Svetlana
Came in and took the window chair.'

As in some dull, Van Dyck madonna
So round and fair of face is she
She's like that stupid moon you see
Up in that stupid sky you honour.'
Vladimir gave a curt reply
And let the conversation die
