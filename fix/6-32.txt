32
He lay quite still and past all feeling
His languid brow looked strange at rest
The steaming blood poured forth, revealing
The gaping wound beneath his breast
One moment backa breath's duration
This heart still throbbed with inspiration
Its hatreds, hopes, and loves still beat
Its blood ran hot with life's own heat
But now, as in a house deserted
Inside itall is hushed and stark
Gone silent and forever dark
The window boards have been inserted
The panes chalked white. The owner's fled
But where, God knows. All trace is dead
