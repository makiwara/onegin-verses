I know that you'll agree, my reader
That our good friend was only kind
And showed poor Tanya when he freed her
A noble heart and upright mind
Again he'd done his moral duty
But spiteful people saw no beauty
And quickly blamed him, heaven knows!
Good friends no less than ardent foes
(But aren't they one, if they offend us?)
Abused him roundly, used the knife
Now every man has foes in life
But from our friends, dear God, defend us!
Ah, friends, those friends!
I greatly fear
I find their friendship much too dear
