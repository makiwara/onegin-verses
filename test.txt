The Latin vogue today is waning,
He had sufficient Latin training
I have no leisure for retailing
But where his genius proved unfailing,
Appear so proud or so forbearing,
At times attentive, then uncaring!
He calls a sleigh as daylight's dimming;
His collar with its beaver trimming
He's off to Talon's, late, and racing,
Quite sure he'll find Kavrin pacing;
He's off!this critic most exacting
Of all that touches art or acting,
And while the people still are tapping,
Still sniffling, coughing, hissing, clapping;
Your interest piqued and doubtless growing
I might describe in terms more knowing
I recollect the ocean rumbling:
Those rushing tides in tumult tumbling
I longed to join the waves in pressing
Upon those feet these lips . . . caressing.
But what of my Eugene? Half drowsing,
While Petersburg, already rousing,
In pleasant hubbub morn's awaking!
The German baker's up and baking,
Yes, soon he lost all warmth of feeling:
And all those beauties, once appealing,
Inconstancy grew too fatiguing;
And friends and friendship less intriguing;
On top of which, they're so unerring,
So circumspect, so strict in bearing,
He crammed his bookshelf overflowing,
Then read and read frustration growing:
I liked his natural bent for dreaming,
His strangeness that was more than seeming,
He who has lived as thinking being
He who can feel is always fleeing
Yet in its mirror not reflecting
Diana's visage recollecting
Filled with his heart's regrets, and leaning
Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
The night grew still. . . with silence falling;
Only the sound of sentries calling,
O when, my soul, with waves contesting,
And caped in storms, shall I go questing
And sure enough a note came flying;
Onegin's uncle, sick and dying,
He gave the message one quick reading,
And then by post Eugene was speeding,
He found the manor fairly bustling
Both friends and foes had come ahustling,
But I was born for peaceful roaming,
My lyre sings! And in the gloaming
The Muse appeared as love was ending
Once free, I seek again the blending
The place Eugene found so confining
Where one who favoured soft reclining
Vladimir Lensky, just returning
From Gottingen with soulful yearning,
In heaven's peaceful desert flying,
That queen of secrets and of sighing.
Devoid of any spark of feeling
As were the arts of social dealing;
As others tell of passions swelling;
Forgotten in his wretched dwelling,
He knew one constant source of dreaming,
One constant wish forever gleaming,
When scarce a boy and not yet knowing
He'd been entranced by Olga growing
Forever modest, meek in bearing,
Like any poet open, caring,
Upon her balcony appearing,
When dancing stars are disappearing
For she, in spite of family feeling,
She found a great deal more appealing;
Twice yearly too they did their fasting;
Were fond of songs for fortune-casting,
Restored to home and its safekeeping,
Upon his neighbour's place of sleeping,
And long he stood in sorrow aching;
'Poor Yorick!' then he murmured, shaking,
So meanwhile, friends, enjoy your blessing:
Its worthlessness needs no professing,
I've closed my eyes to phantoms gleaming,
Yet distant hopes within me dreaming
'The Larin place.'' What reckless daring!
Good God, man, don't you find it wearing
I'll see this Phyllis so provoking
Present me, do.'' You must be joking!'
It's where I find . . . ''More pastoral singing!
Enough, old boy, my ears are ringing!
She sighs . . . and in her soul possessing
The letter she would send caressing
Or gloomy Melmoth, lost and pleading,
Lord Byron, his caprice succeeding,
Night falls; the moon begins parading
Breaks out in mournful serenading.
Her bosom heaves, her cheeks are burning,
Scarce-breathing lips grow still with yearning,
'I couldn't sleep ... O nurse, it's stifling!
'What ails you, Tanya?'' Life's so trifling,
The marriage maker kept on calling
I got so scared . . . my tears kept falling;
I'm on the verge of tears and wailing!'
'My goodness, girl, you must be ailing;
And all the while the moon was shining
And with its murky light defining
Far off Tatyana ranged in dreaming,
And then a sudden thought came gleaming:
And propped upon an elbow, writing,
Pours forth a maiden's blameless plighting.
By joining him at least in grieving,
And blind as ever, still believing,
Her head is bowed, as if she's dozing;
Her light chemise has slipped, exposing
But now her door is softly swinging:
It's grey Filtievna, who's bringing
The day wore on, no word came flying.
All dressed since dawn, dead-pale and sighing,
Then Olga's suitor came a-wooing.
'But tell me, what's your friend been doing?'
'Twas dusk; and on the table, gleaming,
It hissed and sent its vapour steaming
And soon the fragrant tea was flowing
As Olga poured it, dark and glowing,
And all the while her soul was aching,
Then sudden hoofbeats! . . . Now she's quaking. . . .
Tatyana listens, scarcely hearing
And waits impatient in her clearing
And beats an iridescent wing
When captured by some boy in spring;
His eyes ablaze, Eugene stood waiting
Like some grim shade of night's creating;
Of but one thing, till our next meeting.
In this forgotten country dwelling
Perhaps, when time had helped in quelling
And find the country unappealing;
Or when I helped the poor and dying,
Or turned to heaven, softly crying,
You'd start to weep, but all your crying
So judge yourself what we'd be buying,
'For dreams and youth there's no returning;
I love you with a tender yearning,
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
She took it and with languid bearing
But what ensued from Tanya's meeting?
Within her heart the frenzied beating
Her gentle soul, athirst with aching;
Nay, ever more intensely quaking,
Or else (and here I'm far from jesting),
I scare a flock of ducks from resting;
And as I watch them disappearing,
Damns poetry for interfering
To drive the cows outside with ringing;
Inside her hut a girl is singing,
So stay beneath your roof... try reading:
Then rage or drink. . . . Somehow proceeding,
But all that foamy, frothy wheezing
And nowadays I find more pleasing
The fire goes out; the coal, still gleaming,
The rising vapours, faintly streaming,
'And how are our dear neighbours faring?
' 'Just half a glass, old boy, be sparing. . .
Yes, he was loved . . . beyond deceiving . . .
Oh, blest is he who lives believing,
Each pane a fragile pattern showing;
And all the hilltops soft and glowing
Next day as dawn was just advancing,
Tatyana woke and, idly glancing,
And here's a household boy gone sleighing
The rascal froze his fingers, playing,
I'm sure you'll find him most engaging
But I have no intent of waging
Her voice more soft than reed pipe's humming:
Instead, her silken sash untying,
While 'neath her downy pillow lying,
And what an awesome dream she's dreaming:
And all around her, dully gleaming,
Two slender, icebound poles lie linking
And full of doubt, her spirits sinking,
She's reached the wood, the bear still tracking;
A jutting branch looms up, attacking,
Out of a dog-face horns are sprouting;
A haughty skeleton sits pouting
She can't make sense of what she's hearing,
Creeps to the door and, softly peering,
Sees through a crack the strangest thing
A horde of monsters in a ring:
A windmill there was squat-jig dancing
And cracked and waved its sails while prancing;
He's master here, there's no mistaking;
And Tanya, now no longer quaking,
All hooves and trunks grotesque and curving,
Huge horns and bony fingers swerving
Eugene throws wide the door, revealing
To monstrous looks and hellish squealing
'She's mine!' announced Eugene, commanding;
The maid alone was left there standing
Where dawn's vermilion rays are playing;
And lighter than a swallow, saying:
But she ignores her sister's pleading,
Keeps leafing through some book she's reading,
Her dream disturbs her, and not knowing
Tatyana seeks some passage showing
He's brought some news to set them cheering:
The regimental band's appearing!
As mouths start chewing.
Inside her, stormy passion's seething;
The wretched girl is scarcely breathing;
All tragico-hysteric moaning,
Had long since set Eugene to groaning:
(Alas, too salty); now they're bringing,
In bottle with the pitch still clinging,
The bottle pops as cork goes flying;
And now with solemn mien, and dying
And starts to sing, off-key. Loud cheering
The bard, whose modesty's endearing,
Was wondrous tender. If asserting
He'd only teased her with some flirting,
Their festive dinner all too pleasing,
The squires face each other wheezing;
Elated by the music's bouncing,
His tea and rum at once renouncing,
His moment of revenge beginning,
Eugene, with secret malice grinning,
Sed alia temporal Such sporting
(With other capers such as courting)
The latter, hard upon first greeting,
The poet's note about a 'meeting'.
He could have shown some spark of feeling
He should have spoken words of healing,
Or that by morn they'd be debating,
For which of them the grave lay waiting!
But now it's late and time for leaving.
He felt it break with desperate grieving.
Takes up his pen. . . . His verses ring
With all the nonsense lovers sing;
But then at last, as it was dawning,
With drooping head and frequent yawning,
The gleaming pistols wake from drowsing.
The balls go in each bevelled housing.
Four fateful steps. The space decreasing,
Onegin then, while still not ceasing
He lay quite still and past all feeling;
The steaming blood poured forth, revealing
With epigrams of spite and daring
It's pleasant when you see him staring
Be thinking of... or merely feeling,
His blood by slow degrees congealing,
Some bagatelle when you'd been drinking;
Or what if he himself, not thinking,
The frozen corpse on sleigh, preparing
The horses neighed, their nostrils flaring,
Sometimes a shepherd sits there waiting
And sings of Volga fishers, plaiting
Or some young girl from town who's spending
Her summer in the country mending
What tender and oppressive yearning
Possesses me on spring's returning,
Within a dream to which we cling,
Some other and more ancient spring,
Those heady walks for which you're thirsting,
Load up your carriages to bursting,
There was a time when breezes playing
A secret wreath that hung there swaying
Poor Lensky! In his place of resting,
Did he, sad bard, awake protesting
Of fishermen were dimly gleaming.
Tatyana walked, alone and dreaming,
And long she stood, bewitched and glowing,
But now it's late. The winds are blowing,
The golden autumn now arriving.
The North now howls, the winds are driving
As with old friends, she keeps returning
To all her groves and meadows, yearning
They're all aboard and, slowly gliding,
Farewell, secluded place of hiding!
But now they're near. Before them, gleaming,
Its ancient domes and spires streaming
They take her to the Grand Assembly:
The music's roar, the ballroom trembling,
Tatyana looks with eyes unseeing
And loathes this world with all her being;
'My left? But why? It seems like gawking.'
In uniform? The one not talking . . .
My Tanya's conquest taking wing,
Lest I forget of whom I sing
'Is he the same, or is he learning?
In what new guise is he returning?
Because an ardent spirit's daring
Appears absurd or overbearing
But look, the crowd's astir and humming;
The hostess sees a lady coming,
Once more he counts the hours, pacing;
The clock strikes ten: and off he's racing,
Her husband enters, thus arresting
Eugene and he recalled the jesting,
They laughed. Then guests began arriving.
And on the spice of malice thriving,
A traveller home from distant faring,
By his pretentious, studied bearing:
But to the young its raptures bring
As storms refresh the fields of spring.
Or sometimes merely bows on meeting,
Or passes by without a greeting:
And yet although his eyes were reading,
Desires, dreams, and sorrows pleading
He sees a youth, quite still, reposing
On melting snow as if he's dozing
That strikes him with such awful pleading?
Above some letter that she's reading
He enters like a dead man, striding
Through empty hall; then passes, gliding,
Mad with regret and anguished feeling,
Eugene fell down before her, kneeling;
Are empty. ... I'd as soon be trading
This tattered life of masquerading,
And was it you I heard replying
Might hear you speak a friendly greeting,
Nor known this bitter heartache's swelling.
Poor Lensky's muddled mind was swirling,
But still, we welcome you with feeling.
