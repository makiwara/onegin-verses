Or in a grave dispute he'd wear
And our Katnin gave us there
But neither whist, nor gossip there,
But speaks of him. She cannot bear
Some serf girls in the orchard there,
And friendly husbands hard to bear!
Or if she happened anywhere
Behind her back she hears the bear,
His incandescent Olga there.
And on those pages everywhere
The restless hero waiting there
Galop, mazurka, waltz. . . . And there,
'Just never mind . . . now look up there . . .
A cross not many choose to bear).
Than he who brought the lady there
Is quite alone. Some minutes there
He opens up a door. . . . What's there
And when he wished, he'd make appear
The quickly summoned, glistening tear!
But when they learned that in the rear
So he could quickly disappear
To join her life to his career,
Expecting he would soon appear.
He sang life's bloom gone pale and sere
He'd almost reached his eighteenth year.
They held all ancient customs dear;
With Russian pancakes, Russian cheer;
A slave of God and Brigadier
Beneath this stone now resteth here.
Was younger still than me, my dear,
And I was just thirteen that year.
Abandon Hope, Who Enter Here!
Their joy is striking men with fear,
And in her native tongue, I fear,
Could barely make her meaning clear;
You know these days I'm not so clear,
I'll take the letter, never fear.
Asked Tanya's mother, full of cheer;
'He's quite forgotten us, I fear.'
As yet unseen, and yet so dear,
However much I loved you, dear,
Once used to you ... I'd cease, I fear;
Ah, friends, those friends! I greatly fear,
I find their friendship much too dear.
Of southern winters, this is clear;
They seem to go before they're here!
Just plays my stomach false, I fear;
Sedate Bordeaux's good quiet cheer.
Martyn Zadck, Chaldean seer
And analyst of dreams unclear.
That idol whom ripe misses cheer,
The company commander's here!
It's Lensky . . . with Eugene! 'Oh dear!'
The hostess cries, 'At last you're here!'
And waits impatiently to hear.
The answer in his solemn leer.
I have them, and I quote them here:
My springtime's golden days so dear?
'Good God, man, where's your second? Where?'
At such an age, in such a year.
Repose in peace, young poet, here!'
Would dine with him in winter here.
And here's the master's study, dear;
The clouds before them far and near:
That sorceress the winter's here!
Oh, Tanya sweet, come over here
I think I must be dreaming, dear. . . .
Not only woe. . . . It's true, my dear,
I'm good for nothing now, I fear;
With shouts of joy and welcome cheer.
'How Tanya's grown! It seems, my dear,
Tatyana, whisp'ring in her ear:
'Look quickly to your left, my dear.'
He just about went mad, I fear,
That I'd have been the first to cheer!)
Your voice within my soul rang clear. . . .
