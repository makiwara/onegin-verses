She falls .... 'He's here! But all those faces!
O God, what must he think of me!
' But still her anguished heart embraces
A misty dream of what might be.
She trembles, burns, and waits ... so near him!
But will he come? . . . She doesn't hear him.
Some serf girls in the orchard there,
While picking berries, filled the air
With choral song as they'd been bidden
(An edict that was meant, you see,
To keep sly mouths from feeling free
To eat the master's fruit when hidden,
By filling them with song instead
For rural cunning isn't dead!)

The Girls' Song
'Lovely maidens, pretty ones,
Dearest hearts and darling friends,
Romp away, sweet lassies, now,
Have your fling, my dear ones, do!
Strike you up a rousing song,
Sing our secret ditty now,
Lure some likely lusty lad
To the circle of our dance.
When we lure the fellow on,
When we see him from afar,
Darlings, then, let's scamper off,
Pelting him with cherries then,
Cherries, yes, and raspberries,
Ripe red currants let us throw!
Never come to listen in
When we sing our secret songs,
Never come to spy on us
When we play our maiden games!'
