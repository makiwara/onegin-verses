(1-6)7
The less we love her when we woo her,
The more we draw a woman in,
And thus more surely we undo her
Within the witching webs we spin.
Time was, when cold debauch was lauded
As love's high art. . .
and was applauded
For trumpeting its happy lot
In taking joy while loving not.
But that pretentious game is dated,
But fit for apes, who once held sway
Amid our forbears' vaunted day;
The fame of Lovelaces has faded
Along with fashions long since dead:
Majestic wigs and heels of red.
