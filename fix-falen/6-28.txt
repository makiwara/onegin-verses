The foes!
How long has bloodlust parted
And so estranged these former friends?
How long ago did they, warmhearted,
Share meals and pastimes, thoughts and ends?
And now, malignant in intention,
Like ancient foes in mad dissension,
As in a dreadful senseless dream,
They glower coldly as they scheme
In silence to destroy each other. . . .
Should they not laugh while yet there's time,
Before their hands are stained with crime?
Should each not part once more as brother?
. . .
But enmity among their class
Holds shame in savage dread, alas.
