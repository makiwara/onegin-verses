37
'Twas dusk; and on the table, gleaming,
The evening samovar grew hot;
It hissed and sent its vapour steaming
In swirls about the china pot.
And soon the fragrant tea was flowing
As Olga poured it, dark and glowing,
In all the cups; without a sound
A serving boy took cream around.
Tatyana by the window lingers
And breathes upon the chilly glass;
All lost in thought, the gentle lass
Begins to trace with lovely fingers
Across the misted panes a row
Of hallowed letters: E and O.
