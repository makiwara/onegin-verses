She gave the poet intimations
Of youthful ecstasies unknown,
And, filling all his meditations,
Drew forth his flute's first ardent moan.
Farewell, O golden games' illusion!
He fell in love with dark seclusion,
With stillness, stars, the lonely night,
And with the moon's celestial light
That lamp to which we've consecrated
A thousand walks in evening's calm
And countless tearsthe gentle balm
Of secret torments unabated ....
Today, though, all we see in her
Is just another lantern's blur.
