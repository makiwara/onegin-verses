22
Once more he counts the hours, pacing;
Once more can't wait till day is past.
The clock strikes ten: and off he's racing,
And now he's at the porch at last;
He enters in some apprehension;
The princess, to his added tension,
Is quite alone.
Some minutes there
They sit.
Eugene can only stare,
He has no voice.
Without a smile,
And ill at ease, he scarcely tries
To answer her.
His mind supplies
But one persistent thought the while.
His eyes retain their stare;
but she Sits
unconstrained, quite calm and free.
