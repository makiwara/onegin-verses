47
The fire goes out; the coal, still gleaming,
Takes on a film of ash and pales;
The rising vapours, faintly streaming,
Curl out of sight; the hearth exhales
A breath of warmth. The pipe smoke passes
Up chimney flue. The sparkling glasses
Stand fizzing on the table yet;
With evening's gloom, the day has set. . .
(I'm fond of friendly conversation
And of a friendly glass or two
At dusk or entre chien et loup
As people say without translation,
Though why they do, I hardly know).
But listen as our friends speak low:
