He smiled at Lensky's conversation.
Indeed the poet's fervent speech,
His gaze of constant inspiration,
His mind, still vacillant in reach
All these were new and unexpected,
And so, for once, Eugene elected
To keep his wicked tongue in check,
And thought: What foolishness to wreck
The young man's blissful, brief infection;
Its time will pass without my knife,
So let him meanwhile live his life Believing in the world's perfection;
Let's grant to fevered youthful days
Their youthful ravings and their blaze.
