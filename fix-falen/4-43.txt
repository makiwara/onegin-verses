But how is one, in this dull season,
To help the rural day go by?
Take walks?
The views give little reason,
When only bareness greets the eye.
Go ride the steppe's harsh open spaces?
Your mount, if put to try his paces
On treacherous ice in blunted shoe,
Is sure to fall. . .
and so will you.
So stay beneath your roof... try reading:
Here's Pradt or, better, Walter Scott!
Or check accounts.
You'd rather not?
Then rage or drink. . . .
Somehow proceeding,
This night will pass (the next one too),
And grandly you'll see winter through!
