Well-off. . . and handsome in addition,
Young Lensky seemed the perfect catch;
And so, by countryside tradition,
They asked him round and sought to match
Their daughters with this semi-Russian.
He'd calland right away discussion
Would touch obliquely on the point
That bachelors' lives were out of joint;
And then the guest would be invited
To take some tea while Dunya poured;
They whisper: 'Dunya, don't look bored!'
Then bring in her guitar, excited . . .
And then, good God, she starts to bawl:
'Come to my golden chamberhall!'
