14
But look, the crowd's astir and humming;
A murmur through the ballroom steals . . .
The hostess sees a lady coming,
A stately general at her heels.
She isn't hurried or obtrusive,
Is neither cold nor too effusive;
She casts no brazen glance around
And makes no effort to astound
Or use those sorts of affectation
And artifice that ladies share
But shows a simple, quiet air.
She seems the very illustration
Du comme il faut. . .
(Shishkov, be kind:
I can't translate this phrase, I find.)
