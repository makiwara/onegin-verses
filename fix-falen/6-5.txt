Time was, when flunkies in high places
Would praise him for his nasty grit:
He could, it's true, from twenty paces,
Shoot pistol at an ace and hit;
And once, when riding battle station,
He'd earned a certain reputation
When in a frenzied state indeed
He'd plunged in mud from Kalmuk steed,
Drunk as a pig, and suffered capture
(A prize to make the French feel proud!)
.
Like noble Regulus, he bowed,
Accepting hostage bonds with rapture
In hopes that he (on charge) might squeeze
Three bottles daily from Vry's.
