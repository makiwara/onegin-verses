'Oh nurse, your wits are all befuddled!'
'But, sweetheart, I've grown old ... I mean . . .
I'm old;
my mind ... it does get muddled.
There was a time when I was keen,
When just the master's least suggestion. . .
.'
'Oh, nanny, please, that's not the question,
It's not your mind I'm talking of,
I'm thinking of Onegin, love;
This note's to him.''
Now don't get riled,
You know these days I'm not so clear,
I'll take the letter, never fear.
But you've gone pale again, my child!'
'It's nothing, nanny, be at ease,
Just send your grandson, will you please.'
