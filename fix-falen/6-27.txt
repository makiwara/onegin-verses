'My second?'
said Eugene directly.
'Why here he is: Monsieur Guillot,
A friend of mine, whom you. . .
correctly!
Will be quite pleased to greet, I know;
Though he's unknown and lives obscurely,
He's still an honest chap, most surely.
' Zaretsky bit his lip, well vexed.
Onegin turned to Lensky next: 'Shall we begin?'
'At my insistence.'
Behind the mill, without a word.
And while the 'honest chap' conferred
With our Zaretsky at a distance
And sealed the solemn compact fast,
The foes stood by with eyes downcast.
