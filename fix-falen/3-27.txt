Some would that ladies be required
To read in Russian.
Dread command!
Why, I can picture theminspired,
T
he Good Samaritan in hand!
I ask you now to tell me truly,
You poets who have sinned unduly:
Have not those creatures you adore,
Those objects of your verse . . .
and more,
Been weak at Russian conversation?
And have they not, the charming fools,
Distorted sweetly all the rules
Of usage and pronunciation;
While yet a foreign language slips
With native glibness from their lips?
