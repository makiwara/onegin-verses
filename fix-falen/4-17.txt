Thus spake Eugene his admonition.
Scarce breathing and bereft of speech,
Gone blind with tears, in full submission,
Tatyana listened to him preach.
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
She took it and with languid bearing
('Mechanically', as people say),
She bowed her head and moved away. . . .
They passed the garden's dark recesses,
Arriving home together thus
Where no one raised the slightest fuss:
For country freedom too possesses
Its happy rights ... as grand as those
That high and mighty Moscow knows.
