'And happiness was ours ... so nearly!
It came so close!
. . .
But now my fate
Has been decreed.
I may have merely
Been foolish when I failed to wait;
But mother with her lamentation
Implored me, and in resignation
(All futures seemed alike in woe)
I married. . . .
Now I beg you, go!
I've faith in you and do not tremble;
I know that in your heart reside
Both honour and a manly pride.
I love you (why should I dissemble?)
;
But I am now another's wife,
And I'll be faithful all my life.'
