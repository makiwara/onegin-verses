36
And yetalthough his eyes were reading,
His thoughts had wandered far apart;
Desires, dreams, and sorrows pleading
Had crowded deep within his heart.
Between the printed lines lay hidden
Quite other lines that rose unbidden
Before his gaze.
And these alone
Absorbed his soul... as he was shown:
The heart's dark secrets and traditions,
The mysteries of its ancient past;
Disjointed dreamsobscure and vast;
Vague threats and rumours, premonitions;
A drawn-out tale of fancies grand,
And letters in a maiden's hand.
