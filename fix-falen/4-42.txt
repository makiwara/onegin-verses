The frost already cracks and crunches;
The fields are silver where they froze .
.
.
(And you, good reader, with your hunches,
Expect the rhyme, so take itRose!)
No fine parquet could hope to muster
The ice-clad river's glassy lustre;
The joyous tribe of boys berates
And cuts the ice with ringing skates;
A waddling red-foot goose now scurries
To swim upon the water's breast;
He treads the ice with care to test. . .
And down he goes!
The first snow flurries
Come flitting, flicking, swirling round
To fall like stars upon the ground.
