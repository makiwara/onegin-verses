37
Restored to home and its safekeeping,
Young Lensky came to cast an eye
Upon his neighbour's place of sleeping,
And mourned his ashes with a sigh.
And long he stood in sorrow aching;
'Poor Yorick!'
then he murmured, shaking,
'How oft within his arms I lay,
How oft in childhood days
I'd play
With his Ochkov decoration!
He destined Olga for my wife
And used to say: "Oh grant me, life,
To see the day!" '
... In lamentation,
Right then and there Vladimir penned
A funeral verse for his old friend.
