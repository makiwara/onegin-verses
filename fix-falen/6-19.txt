All evening Lensky was abstracted,
Remote one moment, gay the next;
But those on whom the Muse has acted
Are ever thus;
with brow perplexed,
He'd sit at clavichord intently
And play but chords;
or turning gently
To Olga, he would whisper low:
'I'm happy, love . . .
it's true, you know.'
But now it's late and time for leaving.
His heart, so full of pain, drew tight;
And as he bid the girl goodnight,
He felt it break with desperate grieving.
'What's wrong?'
She peered at him, intent.
'It's nothing.'
And away he went.
