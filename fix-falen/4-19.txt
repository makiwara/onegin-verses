What's that?
Just that.
Mere conversation
To lull black empty thoughts awhile;
In passing, though, one observation:
There's not a calumny too vile
That any garret babbler hatches,
And all the social rabble snatches;
There's no absurdity or worse,
Nor any vulgar gutter verse,
That your good friend won't find delightful,
Repeating it a hundred ways
To decent folk for days and days,
While never meaning to be spiteful;
He's yours, he'll say, through thick and thin:
He loves you so!
. . .
Why, you're like kin!
