Forever modest, meek in bearing,
As gay as morning's rosy dress,
Like any poetopen, caring,
As sweet as love's own soft caress;
Her sky-blue eyes, devoid of guile,
Her flaxen curls, her lovely smile,
Her voice, her form, her graceful stance,
Oh, Olga's every trait....
But glance
In any novelyou'll discover
Her portrait there;
it's charming, true;
I liked it once no less than you,
But round it boredom seems to hover;
And so, dear reader, grant me pause
To plead her elder sister's cause.
