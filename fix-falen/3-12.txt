But now our minds have grown inactive,
We're put to sleep by talk of 'sin';
Our novels too make vice attractive,
And even there it seems to win.
It's now the British Muse's fables
That lie on maidens' bedside tables
And haunt their dreams.
They worship now
The Vampire with his pensive brow,
Or gloomy Melmoth, lost and pleading,
The Corsair, or the Wandering Jew,
And enigmatic Sbogar too.
Lord Byron, his caprice succeeding,
Cloaked even hopeless egotism
In saturnine romanticism.
