And now at last the wait has ended;
Her eyes have opened . . . seen his face!
And now, alas! . . . she lives attended
All day, all night, in sleep's embrace
By dreams of him; each passing hour
The world itself with magic power
But speaks of him. She cannot bear
The way the watchful servants stare,
Or stand the sound of friendly chatter.
Immersed in gloom beyond recall,
She pays no heed to guests at all,
And damns their idle ways and patter,
Their tendency to just drop in
And talk all day once they begin.
