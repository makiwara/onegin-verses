But when the age of restless turnings
Became in time our young man's fate,
The age of hopes and tender yearnings,
Monsieur l'Abb was shown the gate.
And here's Onegin liberated,
To fad and fashion newly mated:
A London dandy, hair all curled,
At last he's ready for the world!
In French he could and did acutely
Express himself and even write;
In dancing too his step was light,
And bows he'd mastered absolutely.
Who'd ask for more? The world could tell
That he had wit and charm as well.
