Though pleased with the revenge he'd taken,
Onegin, noting Lensky'd left,
Felt all his old ennui awaken,
Which made poor Olga feel bereft.
She too now yawns and, as she dances,
Seeks Lensky out with furtive glances;
The endless dance had come to seem
To Olga like some dreadful dream.
But now it's over.
Supper's heeded.
Then beds are made;
the guests are all
Assigned their roomsfrom entrance hall
To servants' quarters.
Rest is needed
By everyone.
Eugene has fled
And driven home alone to bed.
