'The way they did in former ages,
Those mighty years still rich in fame. . .
.'
Just solemn odes?
.
.
.
On all our pages?!
Oh come now, friend, it's all the same.
Recall the satirist, good brother,
And his sly odist in The Other
Do you find him more pleasing, pray,
Than our glum rhymesters of today?
.
. . .
'Your elegy lacks all perception,
Its want of purpose is a crime;
Whereas the ode has aims sublime.
' One might to this take sharp exception,
But I'll be mute.
I don't propose
To bring two centuries to blows.
