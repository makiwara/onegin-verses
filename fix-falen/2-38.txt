38
And then with verse of quickened sadness
He honoured too, in tears and pain,
His parents' dust. . . their memory's gladness . . .
Alas! Upon life's furrowed plain
A harvest brief, each generation,
By fate's mysterious dispensation,
Arises, ripens, and must fall;
Then others too must heed the call.
For thus our giddy race gains power:
It waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,
Then crowds its forebears toward the grave.
And we as well shall face that hour
When one fine day our grandsons true
Straight out of life will crowd us too!
