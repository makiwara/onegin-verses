Now home's our heroes' destination,
As down the shortest road they fly;
Let's listen to their conversation
And use a furtive ear to spy.
'Why all these yawns, Onegin? Really!'
'Mere habit, Lensky.'' But you're clearly 
More bored than usual.'' No, the same.
The fields are dark now, what a shame.
Come on, Andryushka, faster, matey!
These stupid woods and fields and streams!
Oh, by the way, Dame Larin seems
A simple but a nice old lady;
I fear that lingonberry brew
May do me in before it's through.'
