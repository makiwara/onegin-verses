He rings in haste and, with a racket,
His French valet, Guillot, runs in
With slippers and a dressing jacket,
And fresh new linen from the bin.
Onegin, dressing in a flurry,
Instructs his man as well to hurry:
They're leaving for the duelling place,
Guillot's to fetch the pistol case.
The sleigh's prepared;
his pacing ceases;
He climbs aboard and off they go.
They reach the mill.
He bids Guillot
To bring Lepage's deadly pieces;
Then has the horses, on command,
Removed to where two oaklings stand.
