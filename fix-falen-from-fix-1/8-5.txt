Forgetting, then, the city's splendour,
Its noisy feasts and grand events,
In sad Moldavia she turned tender
And visited the humble tents
Of wandering tribes;
and like a child,
She learned their ways and soon grew wild:
The language of the gods she shed
For strange and simple tongues instead
To sing the savage steppe, elated;
But then her course abruptly veered,
And in my garden she appeared
A country missinfatuated,
With mournful air and brooding glance,
And in her hands a French romance.
