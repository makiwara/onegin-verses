Yet even in these same afflictions
She found a secret charm in part:
For naturefond of contradictions
Has so designed the human heart.
The holy days are here.
What gladness!

Bright youth divines, not knowing sadness,
With nothing that it must regret,
With all of life before it yet
A distance luminous and boundless. . . .
Old age divines with glasses on
And sees the grave before it yawn,
All thoughts of time returninggroundless;
No matter: childish hope appears
To murmur lies in aged ears.
