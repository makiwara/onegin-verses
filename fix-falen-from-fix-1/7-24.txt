And so, in slow but growing fashion
My Tanya starts to understand
More clearly nowthank Godher passion
And him for whom, by fate's command,
She'd been condemned to feel desire:
That dangerous and sad pariah,
That work of heaven or of hell,
That angel. . .
and proud fiend as well.
What was he then?
An imitation?
An empty phantom or a joke,
A Muscovite in Harold's cloak,
Compendium of affectation,
A lexicon of words in vogue . . .
Mere parody and just a rogue?
