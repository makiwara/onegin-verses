He wrote thuslimply and obscurely.
(We say 'romantically'although,
That's not romanticism, surely;
And if it is, who wants to know?)
But then at last, as it was dawning,
With drooping head and frequent yawning,
Upon the modish word 'ideal'
Vladimir gently dozed for real;
But sleep had hardly come to take him
Off to be charmed by dreams and cheered,
When in that silent room appeared
His neighbour, calling out to wake him:
'It's time to rise!
Past six . . .
come on!
I'll bet Onegin woke at dawn.'
