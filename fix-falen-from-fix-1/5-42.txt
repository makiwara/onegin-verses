Now the mazurka's call is sounded.
Its thunder once could even rack
The greatest hall when it resounded,
And under heels parquet would crack;
The very windows shook like Hades.
But now it's changed: we're all like ladies;
And o'er the lacquered boards we glide.
But in small town and countryside
The old mazurka hasn't faltered;
It still retains its pristine joys:
Moustaches, leaps, heel-pounding noise
Remain the same;
they've not been altered
By tyrant-fashion's high decrees,
The modern Russian's new disease.
