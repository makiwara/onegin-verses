But no, she can't.
What explanation?

Well, she's just promised his good friend
The next dance too.
In God's creation!
What's this he hears?
Could she intend?

And turned coquette!
A fickle toddler!
Already has she mastered guile,
Already learned to cheat and smile!
The blow has left poor Lensky shattered;
And cursing woman's crooked course,
He leaves abruptly, calls for horse,
And gallops off.
Now nothing mattered
A brace of pistols and a shot
Shall instantly decide his lot.
