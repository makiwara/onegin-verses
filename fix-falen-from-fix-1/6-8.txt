He was no fool;
and consequently
(Although he thought him lacking heart),
Eugene would hear his views intently
And liked his common sense in part.
He'd spent some time with him with pleasure,
And so was not in any measure
Surprised next morning when he found,
Zaretsky had again called round;
The latter, hard upon first greeting,
And cutting off Eugene's reply,
Presented him, with gloating eye,
The poet's note about a 'meeting'.
Onegin, taking it, withdrew
And by the window read it through.
