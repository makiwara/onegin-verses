Some others too might well have noted
Poor Tanya's plight;
but every eye
Was at the time in full devoted
To sizing up a lavish pie
(Alas, too salty);
now they're bringing,
In bottle with the pitch still clinging,
Between the meat and blancmanger,
Tsimlynsky wine ... a whole array
Of long-stemmed glasses . . .
(quite as slender
As your dear waist, my sweet Zizi,
Fair crystal of my soul and key
To all my youthful verses tender,
Love's luring phial, you who once
Made me a drunken, love-filled dunce!)
