In them, though, nothing ever alters;
The same old patterns still are met:
Old Aunt Elena never falters
And wears that same tulle bonnet yet;
Still powdered is Lukrya Lvvna;
A liar still, Lyubv Petrvna;
Ivn Petrvich ... no more bright;
Semyn Petrvich . . .
just as tight;
And Anna Pvlovna, as ever,
Still has her friend, Monsieur Finemouch,
Her same old spouse, and same old pooch
Her husband, clubman come whatever,
Is just as meek and deaf, it's true,
And still consumes enough for two.
