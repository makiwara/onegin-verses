But he was wrong;
that idle sinner
Was sleeping soundly even then.
But now the shades of night grow thinner,
The cock hails Vesper once again;
Yet still Onegin slumbers deeply.
But now the sun climbs heaven steeply,
And gusting snowflakes flash and spin,
But still Onegin lies within
And hasn't stirred;
still slumber hovers
Above his bed and holds him fast.
But now he slowly wakes at last,
Draws back the curtains and his covers,
Looks outand sees with some dismay,
He'd better leave without delay.
