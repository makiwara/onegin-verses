He left the rout in all its splendour
And drove back home, immersed in thought;
A swarm of dreams, both sad and tender,
Disturbed the slumber that he sought.
He woke to find, with some elation,
Prince N. had sent an invitation.
'Oh God!
I'll see her. . .
and today!
Oh yes, I'll go!
'and straightaway
He scrawled a note: he 'd be delighted.
What's wrong with him?
. . .
He's in a daze.
What's stirring in that idle gaze,
What's made that frigid soul excited?
Vexation?
Pride?
Or youth's old yen
For all the cares of love again?
