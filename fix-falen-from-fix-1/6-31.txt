He lays a hand, as in confusion,
On breast and falls.
His misted eyes
Express not pain, but death's intrusion.
Thus, slowly, down a sloping rise,
And sparkling in the sunlight's shimmer,
A clump of snow will fall and glimmer.
Eugene, in sudden chill, despairs,
Runs to the stricken youth . . .
and stares!
Calls out his name!No earthly power
Can bring him back: the singer's gone,
Cut down by fate at break of dawn!
The storm has blown;
the lovely flower
Has withered with the rising sun;
The altar fire is out and done!
