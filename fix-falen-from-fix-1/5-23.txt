This noble and profound creation
A roving pedlar one day brought
To show them in their isolation,
And finally left it when they bought
Malvina for three roubles fifty
(A broken set, but he was thrifty);
And in exchange he also took
Two Petriads, a grammar book,
Some fables he could sell tomorrow,
Plus Marmonteljust volume three.
Martyn Zadck soon came to be
Tatyana's favourite.
Now when sorrow
Assails her heart, he brings her light,
And sleeps beside her through the night.
