Tatyana, as her nurse suggested,
Prepared to conjure all night through,
And so in secret she requested
The bathhouse table laid for two.
But then sheer terror seized Tatyana ...
And I, recalling poor Svetlana,
Feel frightened tooso let it go,
We'll not have Tanya conjure so.
Instead, her silken sash untying,
She just undressed and went to bed.
Sweet Lei now floats above her head,
While 'neath her downy pillow lying,
A maiden's looking-glass she keeps.
Now all is hushed.
Tatyana sleeps.
