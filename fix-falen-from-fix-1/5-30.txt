30
Across from Tanyathere they place them;
And paler than the moon at dawn,
She cannot raise her eyes to face them
And trembles like a hunted fawn.
Inside her, stormy passion's seething;
The wretched girl is scarcely breathing;
The two friends' greetings pass unheard;
Her tears well up without a word
And almost fall;
the poor thing's ready
To faint;
but deep within her, will
And strength of mind were working still,
And they prevailed.
Her lips more steady,
She murmured something through her pain
And managed somehow to remain.
